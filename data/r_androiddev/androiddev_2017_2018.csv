I have seen several examples on stack overflow of people implementing connections to multiple devices in a single app but I was unable to find information on simultaneously writing a single characteristic so that all the devices would start counting.    A bit of background on the project - I am making a device that will connect wireless to an android-powered device to accurately count time. There will be multiple of my custom devices in play at a given time (~5-7).  I am designing the peripheral from the ground up so I have control over all the hardware and firmware. I am wondering if BLE is the way to go for this project but it seems the fastest way to network and android device and multiple peripherals. I may end up using a different network hardware and build a host device to interface with the android device. ,1489391287.0,2017-03-13 07:48:07,1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/androiddev/comments/5liiv4/simultaneous_ble_endpoints/

31,How to cover the lag of starting a camera activity?,"In my app, you can press a button to scan a QR code. This spawns our own QR activity, which uses a CameraSource and SurfaceView to display camera input and scan it for codes.

On slower devices, there's a noticeable lag between pressing the button and the QR activity appearing. I think this time is spent opening the camera and binding it to the SurfaceView, which is done in onResume(), _before_ starting to animate the activity in.

The lag is just long enough that you wonder whether the button press worked (although it uses the material ripple).

What are good options to prevent this user confusion?

- **Speed up the camera init**: I don't think this is feasible under the circumstances.
- **Display a loading overlay on the previous activity**: Feels weird. It's not that expensive an operation.
- **Accept that slow devices have worse usability**: Possibly.
- **Tweak the lifecycle calls so that the camera starts after the activity is displayed**: Feasible, but I'd need to re-read the docs. I've spent a while ensuring that permissions and permission prompts are handled correctly in 23+ (which mostly means checking in onResume()), and I'm wary of breaking that.

42,"Is there anything ""wrong"" with this Dagger implementation? Would you improve it somehow?","I've been reading a lot on Dagger 2 and trying to get my head around all the concepts. After reading many articles and looking at many code examples on GitHub projects, I've implemented Dagger 2 on my application with the following structure:

http://pastebin.com/PtJCZZfr

There's a few things that I'm not sure about this implementation that I'd like to discuss...

* I've noticed that most Android applications implement a single `ApplicationComponent` where all `inject()` methods for fragments, activities and whatever are located. In a big and complex app this component might grow quite big. As such I decided to split this into a few logical components like `ApplicationComponent` for Android framework related dependencies, `FragmentComponent` for fragment dependencies and `PojoComponent` for POJO class dependencies. I currently don't have a `ActivityComponent` but that would be another component to add when required. **What do you think of this organization?**

* The above leads me to the component initialization on `MyApplication`. First, I'm required to have a bunch of `get*()` methods for each component, as opposed to just one used everywhere. Second, each component needs to be initialized individually and some modules might be used by multiple components. Both these things give you additional boilerplate. **Maintaining the multiple component implementation, is there a way this could be improved?**

* As you probably noticed on `initializeInjectionComponents`, I'm initializing both `AndroidModule` and `NetworkModule` just once to be used by multiple components. **This seems about right but I'm wondering if it would make sense to always call `new Module()` for every module on every component (instead of a single instance)?**

* Some examples don't use static `get*Component()` methods on `MyApplication`; they use instance methods instead. This always requires an activity reference to access `getApplication()`, followed by a cast to `MyApplication` and then a call to the `get*Component()`. **Is one a better approach than the other or they are both valid with no advantages/disadvantages over the other?**

Besides the above questions, **do you have any other general comments and improvement suggestions?**",1489392582.0,2017-03-13 08:09:42,10.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/androiddev/comments/5ll5j0/is_there_anything_wrong_with_this_dagger/

59,I develop on a Surface Pro 4. Is a custom built dev machine going to be significantly better?,"Core i5 6300U (2 cores, 4 logical CPUs - 2.4 GHz),
8GB RAM,
SSD for storage.

I compile reasonably small apps from github and do some development now and then. I find AS annoyingly slow at compiling a full build and still kinda slow (say 30-60s) if I just make a small change and rebuild the apk (not a clean build). And the UI feels a bit sluggish (not too bad).

I've used Linux for years but using Windows now for unavoidable reasons (that I'm okay with). But every once in a while, I feel like having a Linux headless machine again would be very helpful for Android dev and some occasional debugging (eg: messing around with Raspberry Pi and OpenWrt, etc).

If I can get a significant benefit in compile time with AS, I'm willing to build a Linux machine if it's around $500 (think one of those mini PCs/barebones).

Do you think a headless 4 core (not logical) Core i7 (or similar AMD CPU) + 16 GB RAM + SSD would give me a significant benefit for Android dev over the Surface Pro 4?

Also check out F-Droid for more apps you might be interested in.

Now after you picked an app where you want to contribute, how do you get started? My suggestion is, just install the app and use it for a while. Chances are, you will run into a bug, or notice something that could be improved. Alternatively, you can just check the projects issue tracker for something you're interested in. Just try to keep it simple in the beginning.

Before you start programming, it's a good idea to get in contact with the developers. If there's no open issue for your contribution, you should open one to make sure the developers agree with your proposed solution (and they can give you some help if you ask). After that, clone the repository, find the right spot in the source code, and fix the problem. Then create a pull request on Github. The developers might have some comments and you might have to change some things. But this shouldn't be hard, especially if you did a small change. And that's it, your first contribution!",1489395153.0,2017-03-13 08:52:33,301.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/androiddev/comments/5lqdvw/do_you_want_to_contribute_to_an_open_source_app/

94,Looking for students to test an innovative learning method based on text chat. Free of charge.,"I'm an ex Google engineer turned educator and I want to completely change the way people learn to code.

I learned most of my coding by chatting with people online. For me, it's a no brainer: text chat is a great way to learn programming. Text chat is much more efficient than face to face interaction. I'd like to put this idea to the test by teaching students to program an Android application.

Here's what the student gets: 

- Practical experience needed to build an android application

- Hours of interaction with a seasoned professional

- Professionally prepared learning material

- Someone to help you solve your problems on the spot

- Tons of live interaction with peers

- Real programming skills beyond the ""follow the recipe"" formula of other online platforms.


I'd like to do a test run for two weeks, free of charge. The only catch is that you'll need to commit several hours of your day, every day, for two weeks. Busy people need not apply. You also need some amount of programming experience. I'm not going to teach you the basics of programming. You'll need to know:

- How to define a method

- How to define a class

- How to inherit from another class

- How to implement an interface

Interested parties can apply by visiting https://jacqueslenormand.com/landing . The pilot project starts on January 23rd. Class time is Monday to Friday, 6 to 8PM (EST).

&gt; onPause() execution is very brief, and does not necessarily afford enough time to perform save operations. For this reason, you should not use onPause() to save application or user data, make network calls, or execute database transactions; such work may not complete before the method completes. Instead, you should perform heavy-load shutdown operations during onStop(). For more information about suitable operations to perform during onStop(), see onStop(). For more information about saving data, see Saving and restoring activity state.


if they do lose state on pause , and activity didn't transition to onStop how do you store state then ??

115,Static object vs SharedPreferences,"Hello,
I know there are many questions about this on stackoverflow, but I would like to hear your opinions too on this topic. 

So there is a scenario when you need several data across the whole application (likely an object). For example at app start you get something from an API and you need to hold that object (and modify also) until the user exits. If this data needed to be persistent then clearly the SharedPref comes to solve this. But when doesn't need to be persistent then what is the ""right"" or ""mostly used"" way to keep that object? I am talking about plain data (nothing context related). 

So besides the sharedpref, it could be kept as a static member field in some util class or wrapped into a singleton? I do not like this kind of solutions because the OS can kill your app that is in the background and in that case you just lost your static data, right? Passing the object across the entire app is pain in the ass so meeh..

An idea would be to store the object in a static field and also in sharedpref, I mean when you initialize the object then you also save the state into sharedpref, then later if you need to use that object you check if it is null the static field, if so you retrieve from sharedpref, otherwise the static field can be used. Of course this means you need too save every change when you modify the object. This logic could be wrapped into some manager class.

What do you think? Or how you guys usually solve this?

This means i have no way of tracking users with outdated Google Services app, and i can't even count how many users I'm ignoring. Am i missing something? Is there a way around it?

131,What Linux distro would you suggest for development?,"I have started development on Linux Mint 18 Cinnamon and then installed KDE Neon to another partition. But I am not 100% satisfied with both so far. Few findings:  

 - Mint is heavy on RAM and low on Processor usage. AS + gradle builds take almost 3.5G/4G ram and leave no room for firing up browser. Without AS, chrome alone takes 1.5G RAM for normal usage. Desktop environment takes as much as 700mb RAM idle. Its very lean on processor. Even during builds, Processors go light and maintain 100% for few seconds only. Idle state is ~1%

 - KDE Neon is very low on RAM and heavy on processor. The whole desktop runs on300mb and AS with same settings as Cinnamon takes  takes 2.5G/4G ram. I fire up chrome and it takes max 600 mb. I am able to run Chrome + AS and still have 400 mb left. But this takes toll on processor. it always runs near 100% on gradle builds and 10% idle.

What distro are you using? What would be good to balance both?

179,"Android, IOIO and Low Power / Sleep Operation","I'm beginning a project to try to create a motion-triggered cellular game camera.  With some work, I think I can create something that takes better pictures, is more customizable, and comes in at a significantly lower price point than commercially available options.  I'm using an android phone, an IOIO OTG, a motion sensor and a battery pack to power the whole thing.

I've spent some time tinkering with Arduinos, so I feel fairly comfortable with the hardware end of things, but I think the Android side of the project is where I'm going to run into the most trouble with.  I have a programming background, but haven't done much / any Android development.

I'm starting the project today, so I don't have specific questions yet, but I'm looking for general direction from others who either have experience with developing apps to run with super low power consumption, and those who have experience with the IOIO or similar devices.

* How hard is it to get an app to run in lock / sleep mode, at least to the point that it's triggered &amp; wakes the phone up to perform a task and go back to sleep.
* Is it possible to wake a phone from sleep mode with an external input?
* Any general tips for dropping device power usage to a bare minimum, and keep the power consumed by an app as low as possible?  In this case the app will need to trigger the camera &amp; then the cell antenna, but when it's not running none of this needs to be enabled.
* Any general advice for a project like this?

I appreciate any input, and will check back in once I've dug into development on this project! ",1489407391.0,2017-03-13 12:16:31,1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/androiddev/comments/5mf7lk/android_ioio_and_low_power_sleep_operation/
180,A Newbie Question Regarding Saving Data Cross Platform,"I should preface this with the fact that I'm brand new to Android and iOS development. After doing a bit of research and totally confusing myself, I thought I'd reach out to this community for help!

I want my app to work cross platform. It's a workplace collaboration app. I want users to be able to save notes that any coworker can access from their smartphones or desktops. I've been struggling with the idea of the ""sync"" aspect of my idea. How will the data be saved and accessed by each user?

Can someone point me in the right direction here? I did a bit of research on webservices and SQL, but I'm not sure if that's really the best way to accomplish this.

207,"Can I get a plain Java library to work with Android, without Jack, and without the source and target versions in my build.gradle?","I wrote [a Java library](https://github.com/Stuie/papercut) to help with tech debt. The other day I got [a feature request](https://github.com/Stuie/papercut/issues/5) to remove the sourceCompatibility and targetCompatibility of `JavaVersion.VERSION_1_7` because it causes a warning when building a project with JDK8.

I am under the impression that Java 8 support in Android is only possible with the Jack compiler, and that removing the compatibility lines in my build.gradle will cause the library not to work without Jack.

Is there any way I can have my library work with Android, without the Jack requirement, as well as plain Java projects built with Java 8?

Jack adoption seems extremely low based on a couple of quick Github code searches.

216,Building a Camera App using OpenCV,"Hello, so I have been working on a project where I have made a 2x2x2 rubiks cube solver and I completed that and I want to make an application where it takes pictures of the stickers and based on their hue range assign a number to that sticker. (for example if the color of the sticker was white based on the hue range I would then give it a number like 0.) I have been working in Java and know not a lot about Android Development but have some experience. I have worked with a simple application that integrates openCV into an android app and changes the view with `rgba` and `Canny` view. But I have no clue how to do what I need to do to make my app work.  

Here is what I have thought I should do:
    
1. Divide the camera view into 4 boxes with lines.
2. In those boxes integrate a predominate hue checker.
3. So say if hue in box 0 is from 50-100 the color must be white.
4. In my look up table all cube states are encoded in numbers so white would register as 0, 1 as orange, 2 green etc.
5. So after the whole cube is scanned I then have those numbers and check my lookup table for that number sequence and print out the string with that sequence.

The thing is I don't know how to do any of this (Mainly the camera processing). I do have a current method of entering cubes right now. I user scanner input to enter in the numbers and then search the file for that position. However, I want to do it with the camera app. Any tips or guidance would be really appreciated.

235,"When publishing free app, do I have to still provide my real address to public?","I would like to stay away from Google play ,but because its probably used by 99% users to download apps here, I would like to move my app there also..

If I publish it as free app (also no in-app payments) do I have to still provide my real address to Google and it will be visible to anyone?

The app is game making indirectly fun of politics (corruption..) in my country and I really do not want to show my real address and then have some problem with mafia or whoever is working with politics.. 

There are only few company who offer hosting of physical mailbox ,but only for bussiness not for person

What if I put fake address , do Google send anything to this address?

I am highly demotivated. My apps do not get installs as expected. The app on which I worked real hard was a Music Player which I created from scratch, spend around a year's time on, got just 5000 installs in 9 months. Whereas I see a rip-off music player app (I can talk about it in detail) gets 50000 downloads because of rushed marketing in Facebook groups. I also tried Facebook groups but I think I ran out of luck.

An incremental build takes ~15 seconds just for a single line change and this feels ridiculously too long. This is on a 2015 MBP with 16gb of RAM and a SSD.

When I profile the gradle build, the majority of the time is spent doing: **transformClassesWithDexForDebug** but I don't really understand what that means.

I've done all the typical Gradle speedup tricks. Parallel, dexInProcess, daemon, etc.

I use databinding and I've read that some people think this is what might cause such long build times?

I was curious to see if other people have similar build times and I'm just being greedy or what.

276,Looking for some advice and opinions regarding Android dev in New York,"I'm looking to get into Android development professionally. I'm trying to get a better idea of what I should be expecting, and I have some pretty specific goals. I wanted to post here to get advice, opinions, and just to get an idea if what I want to do is realistic. This post will probably get pretty long.

I'm a 26 year old who graduated with a Computer Science &amp; Engineering degree (but with a sub-par GPA) from a well respected state school (Uconn). After graduating I got a job in the insurance industry doing database work, mostly SQL dev with some .Net thrown in occasionally. I've been doing this for 3 years now, not counting my 2 summer internships. The work is fairly uninteresting, the company is huge and super conservative so there's not much innovation, especially on the tech side of things, and 95% of my coworkers at over 40. It's not great, but not terrible either. I don't need to be on the bleeding edge, working in some super fast-pace corner of the tech world. In fact, I don't really want that.

I've always wanted to work on Android, and I've always wanted to live in New York City. I want to work with other smart, young people, doing interesting stuff. But I don't want to work 80 hours a week in a cut-throat, fast pace, high-stress environment. Currently I'm living in Hartford on a lease that ends in September, so that's most likely when I'll be looking to make the move. I've dabbled in Android development before, I took a Coursera course a while back on Android dev, and I'm currently finishing up Udacity's ""Developing Android Apps"" course. After that I plan on working on my own little side projects to build up some sort of portfolio. Hopefully I can get something into the app store by around summer time. Even if it's something super simple that's been done a hundred times before. So I'm working on this stuff on the side and trying to become more consistent at doing so. I've always kept up with the industry, and Android dev scenes so I kinda know what's up. I just need to put that into practice. Though it can be tough with a full-time job. I want to be able to put all my effort into Android, but that really isn't an option for me to do that unless it is my day job.

Anyways, what I really want to ask is this... Is is realistic for me to expect to find a job as a beginner Android dev that meets the following criteria:

* Make a comfortable living by NYC standards ($80k-ish)
* Be able to learn and be mentored on the job
* Work at a larger company as part of a large-ish team (I'm someone who appreciates a fair amount of job security and not being the sole person responsible for something)
* Is a full-time position, not on a contract basis

278,Looking for other dev's opinions regarding an XML layout file,"I'm learning android dev and would like to go into it professionally, so I'm looking for any tips or critiques. This might be a pretty trivial question, but I figured it wouldn't hurt to ask.

I'm working through Udacity's ""Developing Android Applications"" course and right now I'm trying to get my UI to match their mockups so I'm comparing my layout outlines to theirs. [This is theirs](http://imgur.com/a/B8kjz) and [this is mine](http://imgur.com/a/2OVRZ), and as for the XML files [this is theirs](https://github.com/udacity/Sunshine-Version-2/blob/5.18_redlines_finish/app/src/main/res/layout/fragment_detail.xml) [and this is mine](https://gist.github.com/int-a/cc43dad6f6da9d5c230a1dd6a68f4a93).

Am I missing some important reasons to do it exactly the same as they did? Or, as an experienced developer, would you consider this fine? How would this go in a professional setting? I realize ""professional setting"" can vary *a lot* but how would you handle it?

Alternatively, are there better and more widely used tools/methods to develop and work with UI? I realize the answer to this question is ""of course there are other ways to create a UI"". But I guess I'm asking if XML is still generally the defacto way to work with UI? My understanding is that the graphical editor in Android Studio isn't great.

Thanks for any advice!

319,How does Facebook show system permission dialogs using the in-App locale?,"The Facebook app lets you change your app locale to something different than your Phone's system locale.  

Using a different locale in your app is relatively straightforward.

What isn't straightforward is that somehow Facebook is showing the system permission dialogs using the in-app locale. 

i.e. system is set to English, in FB app set locale to Chinese.  When you click on the Photo icon for the first time - the permission dialog is coming up in Chinese.  (Sometimes there is a lag - if it comes up in English, hit Deny and press Photo again).

Anyone know how they are doing this?

I don't have clear if this should be with in app purchase or if it can be directly using Credir / Debit card, by the policies of google play

https://play.google.com/about/monetization-ads/payments/

The payment could be trough the app, but the users could connect outside of the app, let's say Windows 10 or iPhone. In app purchase takes 30% of the money while Credit / Debit card does not.

I want to make clear that content on the app does not get unlock. Is just the ability of create your team and give access to your team (and you actually do this trough the web, not the app)

365,Choosing between ConstraintLayout and traditional layouts,"I am searching to make a simple grid to decide which layout to use for a new layout LL vs (P)RL vs CL.

I do not count AdapterViews : ListView, RecyclerView, GridView etc (easy to see) or FrameLayout more used as template or anchor for other layouts.

What do we do when designing a new layout ?

We look at the graphical specifications and identify simple (linear) groups and complex ones

Simple are LL, complex are RL

LL become RL when there is more than 1 nest

RL become PRL if there is proportions

RL/PRL become CL if the layout is more complex 

What is more complex ?

 * more than 4 relative views (group of views relative between them (not including the parent RL)) to begin to profit for CL facilities (as guidelines and designer)

 * raising certain flags / situation RL manages bad : 
    - centering of 2 packed views
    - spread and spread inside
    - margin different upon visibility
    - etc (have you other common situations for which RL is bad ?)

Are you agree with that ? Have you other opinions you want to share ?

For the past two - three days I am thinking about the overall direction in which Android is going.

Do you think it will be around after 5-10 years? And do you think it will stick to just running mobile devices?

Here are my 2 cents on the topic:
Regarding the first question - I'm not 100% sure. Let's say around 90%. Although Android is backed by one of the biggest companies in the world (Google), 5-10 years is enough time for some disruptions to happen.

About the second one - for me the most logical move for Android is not to restrict itself to only handset devices. And we are actually seeing that. Wearables running Android are trying to make their way to the top. And now with Android Things out, we clearly have a sign that Android won't be associated only with mobile devices. In my opinion, IoT devices running on Android are knocking on our door.

401,big RealmResult: how to iterate through all of it without clogging memory?,"Hi there,
my app uses Realm as a database, it's lightning fast and very efficient thanks to the lazy loading; that's great because I have thousands of string-heavy objects and I need to show their data in a RecyclerView, Realm avoids loading them all into memory until accessed, which is perfect and provides a smooth experience with great performances despite the amount of data involved.
Problem is, in a particular method I need to actually iterate the whole list and access a field for a comparison; this loads a ton of data into memory (over 100 MiB!) and isn't exactly ideal.
I'm currently iterating it with a foreach, am I doing it wrong? Is there a way to unload the already evaluated object from memory on each iteration? What else could I do?
Thanks in advance

EDIT: a few more details

it's a synchronization algorithm which is supposed to work with a very bad back-end which wasn't originally though for this kind of usage and I'm not allowed to modify whatsoever.
I need to delete from my Realm any object that has been deleted on the remote server. Problem is: all I have at my disposal is an endpoint which replies with a snapshot of the current remote database status, in JSON format.
I do not get a ""variations"" JSON which tells me which object may have been deleted or edited, not to mention anything even fancier then that like push notifications triggering on every change. Nope. All I can do is poll the server, and get back a huge JSON.
So, if an object gets deleted from the server, the next JSON I get naturally lacks such object: I don't know in advance the id of the deleted object. I need to manually spot them and delete such objects form the local realm database on the app.
In order to do so, I couldn't think of anything else then iterating through the whole realm, get the id for each object and compare it with each object's id on the JSON in order to find the missing ones.",1489430227.0,2017-03-13 18:37:07,3.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/androiddev/comments/5npdk2/big_realmresult_how_to_iterate_through_all_of_it/
402,How do I best understand Activities and Fragments?,"Howdy, I have been developing with Android for about 2 years now, but it has been 100% self-taught. I have been a software engineer for 20 years, so I'm far from a junior developer.

I have known that I never really understood Activities and Fragments like I should, and have just gone with the flow, assuming that I'll understand it in time (like I do with unfamiliar concepts in any other language/platform)

However, I have recently realized that I just *don't* get it. I feel like understanding them is like when I first tried to understand pointers or objects, and I haven't had that A-Ha moment yet. In addition, I've started to realize how much I am missing about android fundamentals by not really understanding these concepts.

Is there anywhere I can go to really read, and understand these concepts? Obviously Stack Exchange is not where you go to learn concepts, and finding a good Google document that both compiles, and explains the ""why"" of something is rare.

---

Any further is just context.

I have published a few apps, one of which is moderately successful. My apps typically have one primary activity, and maybe another activity if it needs to GCM, Widgets, or Preferences. The main Activity will have a number of fragments, essentially one for each major function of the app. I've been hit and miss in getting all aspects of the fragments to work. Sometimes, onHiddenChanged() gets called, sometimes, it's not. Sometimes, I can get onClick() to work, sometimes I can't.

I am a developer in the US, and I have never done an android application before (outside of basic stuff). I have recently decided I would give it a go. Part of my application involves the user clicking a button, and storing their Lat and Long into a sql DB. This of course would be known to the user. It will actually be the sole purpose of the button. I am not looking to create a new maps or anything, but I do want to see how the points correlate, and give the user info back from that calculation. My question is are there any legal issues with storing a users lat and long when they press a button as long as they know and agree to it? Am I required to encrypt the data that I store involving location? I want to be sure to develop ethically, and not violate any privacy laws.

482,Research on improving Android software quality. Please send me your bugs!,"Hi /r/androiddev I am working with a computer science research project with a public university where we are interested in finding ways to make software development less bug prone.  Specifically I am looking at places where the Android object lifecycles or other callbacks indicate when you can and cannot call a method.  We are looking for open source applications where bugs have been introduced and fixed in the Git version history.  Additionally simple descriptions of where these bugs have caused problems for you as a developer are helpful!


A specific example of this would be the MediaPlayer object where ""start"" can only be called after the ""onPrepared"" callback has happened.

Example (truncated for brevity):


    class MyActivity extends Activity implements OnPreparedListener{
          void onCreate(){
              m = new MediaPlayer();
              ... //set up media player to download file from internet
              m.prepareAsync();
              m.setOnPreparedListener(this);
          }
          void onPrepared(){}
          void onClick(){
              m.start(); // May log an exception and not play here if clicked too quickly
          }
     }



Other examples:

- Fragment.startActivity() and Context.getString()  can only be called when the - Fragment is attached to an Activity.

Google api client must be connected before most methods can be called including things like LocationManager.

Additionally examples of individual objects where calling methods in the wrong order can cause a crash are also useful. Examples:

- AsyncTask.execute() cannot be called twice.
- A View cannot be added to two different parent views.

Thank you for your time and bugs!

I want to try and work on improving my android dev skills before the internship starts and now i wondering how i should best achieve that goal. Maybe try and make some personal projects or does someone know a good resource for improving android skills?

I got the Studio. The download is ~1.7GB. OK, it was recommended.

After download during the first set-up it downloads few more GB. Images and stuff. OK.

While building some random sample from android more downloads. Stuff like junit, platform tools(?) and what not.

The GUI kind-of feels like it is asking google servers about every action I take.

After a while this is the state of my c:\Android folder.

Sigh.

Google, why can't you guys be like visual studio? Just install 30-40 GB in one go and get over with it. Don't keep downloading stuff. We're not retards. If junit is missing we'll download it. 

And now if a second developer needs to go through setting up his dev. env. he'll need to download so many of these things again or bing around hacks for ""offline"" install. Sad...bandwidth doesn't grow on trees here in the 3rd world.

Also control the huge number of files.

586,"I need a partner, but whom? Android-, Linux or a Game-Developer?","Hey Guys, my name is Baris and I am a communication designer from Berlin.

I am working for almost two years at a VR project based on the Gear VR. As a designer I have another view of how a mainstream-ready and mobile VR device should look like and started to prototype a product and software design.

I met a technical engineer last year (who unfortunately is unavailable until july) who is ready to work with me on this project. So, we started with the Odroid XU4 and a Bosch 9axis gyroscope and thats how we got at the hardware side...

On the software side I have designed a working concept of the OS and some games as a proof-of-concept for my special idea of VR content in Unity3D and running on the Oculus Home software with the Gear VR.

Now, due my engineer is working on his master thesis I would like to move forward as far as I can. But I can not do it all work by myself. First I am not a gamedesigner or even a gamedeveloper. Second, I would like to get a taste of buildiing a company, marketing, strategies etc to not get in trouble when we are ready.

So I need someone who is able to develop the content in C# (3D assets and stuff can be bought in the assetstore or could be just a simple concept-design) and I need someone who is able to create some kind of a whole new OS build only for VR.

And at this point I am stuck:
What do I really need? I have an engineer and I have my concepts. The second - larger - step is to get this idea funded. But without a running system - my idea is a to build a standalone mobile game console based on linux/android - I cant proof if all this is even possible or not. So to find that out, I would like to know where to start, since android is based on linux.

So, I know you can start linux from scratch. And I know that you can start even android from scratch. I just run all neccessary packages and am able to start an apk (or whatever) to get into my OS and start my content!

Sounds easy, but I know it is not! The real question is, who is it worth to get shares on the - hopefully - in the near future funded project?

Should I give the shares to a Linux developer and develop a stable, customized OS for vr content and get all the hardware/software shit done?

Or should I share the idea with someone who is more into gamedev and can make the idea look great and win some funding.

I am ready to fail with my idea. I am also ready to work for another two years to get this idea proven or not. But I need someone who is a crack in development and knows how to get shit done. But which one is the best for me?

Besides: It is very hard to find some devs. If you know any community where I can take a look for someone who is with me, please post it.

You should not have a layout file at all. Instead, create a layer-list drawable and set it as your android:windowBackground in the theme for your splash activity.

This way, your splash activity will not have to wait in line to inflate its layout. The window background drawable is set instantly. The moment you open your app, the splash screen will be there.

605,Implementing in Scala and hitting the main dex limit: options?,"I'm implementing my app in Scala and recently had to tweak my Proguard rules after hitting the 65k method main dex limit.  I don't think my app is very large, and I'm disturbed by how close to the limit I still am.  Here are the super-packages that are contributing large numbers of methods:

* scala: 34101 (24660 from scala.collection)
* akka: 16470
* android.support: 7547
* com.google: surprisingly, only 1229
* my application: only 2706

I can eliminate my usage of Akka by switching to a message bus designed for Android (I used Akka because I'm familiar with it and trust it) and I hope that eliminating Akka will drastically reduce the number of methods included from scala.collection.

I have also thought about tightening up my Proguard rules for Akka.  Keeping akka.** seems ridiculous!  Yet that's the only Proguard rule for Akka I've seen.  If other people aren't being more aggressive, I assume they've had bad experiences when they tried.  (EDIT:  Of course after posting this I remembered that I didn't really understand Proguard yet when I first configured Proguard for Akka, so I skipped over anything that required more than a handful of rules.  Looking now I see there are some examples of tighter Proguard configs for Akka.)

Right now I'm leaning towards taking out Akka and seeing how that affects the numbers, but I'd love to hear other people's experiences with Scala on Android.  Have you hit the limit?  How did you deal with it?  Do you use Akka?

Any tips or war stories will be greatly appreciated!

621,How do Android background services work?,"Hi,

I'm not an Android developer (nor do I plan to be any time soon) but I am technical, have basic knowledge of development and work in IT. Apologies in advance for any 'noob' terminology user here...

I recently bought a smart watch but was having trouble keeping the Bluetooth connection going with my Android phone (Galaxy S6 Edge Plus).

I contacted the manufacturer, (Armani in this case) who advised that to keep the watch in sync and connected to the phone, the Armani smart watch app needs to be running in the background at all times. If you click the multi task button and swipe it away, it will stop working.

This seemed logical and I have tested the theory. Whilst still not perfect, it is better. I questioned the support person as to why this isn't a service set up running in the background. It seems wrong to me that having the app interface running should be required to keep the connection alive. Especially when it's quite a normal activity to close all multi tasked apps and the watch is designed to be 'on' all of the time.

They argued that it does run in the background but to me, what this is doing is app multitasking and not a background service.

I suppose my question is:
Is there an equivalent to Windows services in the Android world that an app developer could use to resolve the problem explained above?


If there is, it would be great if you can supply some sources that I can send to them as proof. I've Googled 'Android Services' but a lot of the documentation seems to talk about how services can interact with the user interface which is not the same thing..

622,[Help] Upgrading opensource libraries to RxJava 2,"I'm in the process of updating some of my libraries in [github](https://github.com/pakoito?utf8=%E2%9C%93&amp;tab=repositories&amp;q=&amp;type=source&amp;language=) to RxJava 2. I'm currently stuck in two separate problems, and would like external input as to how to approach it, because you're the clients in the end:

## Problem A: coexistence of versions 1 and 2

There are two possible approaches: 

* Bump the library version to 2.X and change the dependency to RxJava 2. This makes it impractical to have both 1.X and 2.X versions coexisting
* Create a separate project/module that uses RxJava2 and they coexist. I wouldn't expect updates to the 1.X version, but most libraries are small, complete and self-contained

## Problem B: the missing interfaces

With RxJava 2 release, some of the function/action interfaces were moved from the [main repository](https://github.com/ReactiveX/RxJava/tree/2.x/src/main/java/io/reactivex/functions) into the [RxJava2Extensions](https://github.com/akarnokd/RxJava2Extensions/tree/master/src/main/java/hu/akarnokd/rxjava2/functions) package. Given that this isn't a dependency everyone would enjoy and use, I have the options of:

* Using RxJava2Extensions as a dependency when required
* Create a copy of the same interfaces on the same package as RxJava2Extensions and hope for the best when resolving dependencies with maven
* Create a new set of interfaces to live on a new package

So with this two issues, which approach would you take?",1489451725.0,2017-03-14 00:35:25,12.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/androiddev/comments/5owuh0/help_upgrading_opensource_libraries_to_rxjava_2/

How would I unit test this? Is there a way to say, ""run this test with these permsisions""?

I tried doing an adb grant via a Gradle task right before assembleDebugAndroidTest, but it complains that my test package hasn't requested permissions and throws a SecurityException.

What's the best practice / convention here? Thanks all!

UPDATE:
I ended up making a separate test specific module for this. The main of this module has a DummyActivity which I use in my on-device tests with ActivityTestRule solely to request permission. For some reason this also made my adb pm grant Gradle task work, so no UI interaction is avoided.

639,Coding an icon pack,"EDIT: Found out about IconShowcase, seems easier. May edit this post later

Hi androiddev,

Lately I've been interested to make an icon pack. I found some tutorial on xda but it seemed outdated after I found out eclipse + ADT isn't used anymore.

I've tried java before and I can understand the code, but I probably won't be able to write it myself. And thus I came to the idea to base it off an open-source icon pack, such as ""Material Open Source"" icon pack on GitHub. So I installed android studio, installed everything it required me to install and got my phone to run the app (without any edits). Now this is awesome, however I want to achieve a few things:

 * Change the color scheme
 * Change the app/project name everywhere. Is there an easy way to replace this quickly ?
 * I want to properly credit MaterialOS for using it somewhere.
 * I'm making this app for a bunch of friends and myself, so I only need to add the apps we got installed. So I don't need the ""request icons"" tab. I'm still interested in sharing the app with anyone's who wants it anyway, which is why I still want to create a legal project with proper credit etc.
 * What should the package name be? I googled but I'm not sure. If I remember correctly I can just use my GitHub URL right?

Now fully learning java for this seemed quite time-consuming, and I don't have too much time on my hands because of exams in 3 weeks. Should I anyway? Or only parts of it?

669,Is it crazy trying to develop an app with no app experience for a very small company?,"I'm currently trying to assess if this is even a reasonable idea that is being passed around. 

My (very small) company currently mails monthly statements to it's clients. We have less than 100 customers and we are only b2b. 

We're trying to modernize which includes a new website with a better look and the idea of using an app for near real-time reporting has been thrown around. 

How hard would it be to develop an app that has a login screen for a customer that just serves data to them. There would be no interaction back. All we need to do is push weekly figures and a sales graph to an app and have the option to save that as email or pdf for the client. 

Our budget is basically ""whatever time someone in the office can dedicate to it."" Which would probably be me writing the entire app. I'm reasonably tech savvy but I've never developed an app before. 

Is this a crazy idea? I don't know what I don't know so maybe what I'm thinking of is far more complicated than I realize... or maybe this is an easy project. ",1489456205.0,2017-03-14 01:50:05,5.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/androiddev/comments/5p5xnc/is_it_crazy_trying_to_develop_an_app_with_no_app/

I'm using PreferenceFragmentCompat to build these settings screens, that go something like:

`TopLevelSettingsFragment` -&gt; `SecondLevelSettingsFragment` -&gt; `ThirdLevelSettingsFrament`

The idea being that you get to `ThirdLevelSettingsFragment` by starting from the TopLevel, then navigating to the SecondLevel, then to the ThirdLevel. These are fragment transactions with a backstack.

I know I can deeplink into the hosting activity and start a fragment that way, but is there a good way to mimic that navigation?

Also, It was really easy to create two versions of the app. I did that, and will take the approach of the Relay For Reddit developer by including an in-app purchase option in the free version. 
The benefit of the paid app, is less permissions, less space, and easier to maintain (on my side). I appreciate your suggestions and will push myself to ship the free version with in-app purchases.

689,"For those of you who use Conductor, how do you handle deep links/URI based navigation?","My goal is to have deep links within the application so I can navigate declaritively.

Having a 'superRouter' of sorts will allow me to map deep links to different controllers; similar to how routers on web pages work. I can then navigate within my application but just linking to the destination's deep link/URI.

It seems faily easy to imagine a way to have top level mappings like:

`/tasks/ -&gt; TasksController()`

`/tasks/{taskID} -&gt; TasksController(taskID)`

However I'm having trouble figuring out how one would handle something like this:


`/tasks/{taskID}/notes -&gt; &lt;???&gt;`

`/tasks/{taskID}/notes/{noteID} -&gt; &lt;???&gt;`


Here are some examples of other libraries that have implemented what I am talking about.
#[Routable Android](https://github.com/clayallsopp/routable-android)

Example setup



    // Set the global context
    Router.sharedRouter().setContext(getApplicationContext());
    // Symbol-esque params are passed as intent extras to the activities
    Router.sharedRouter().map(""users/:id"", UserActivity.class);
    Router.sharedRouter().map(""users/new/:name/:zip"", NewUserActivity.class);


grabbing param info


    import com.usepropeller.routable.Router;
    public class UserActivity extends Activity {
        @Override
        public void onCreate(Bundle savedInstanceState) {
            super.onCreate(savedInstanceState);
            Bundle intentExtras = getIntent().getExtras();
            // Note this extra, and how it corresponds to the "":id"" above
            String userId = intentExtras.get(""id"");
        }
    }

    public class NewUserActivity extends Activity {
        @Override
        public void onCreate(Bundle savedInstanceState) {
            super.onCreate(savedInstanceState);

            Bundle intentExtras = getIntent().getExtras();
            // Corresponds to the "":name"" above
            String name = intentExtras.get(""name"");
            // Corresponds to the "":zip"" above
            String zip = intentExtras.get(""zip"");
        }
    }

Example usage

    // starts a new UserActivity
    Router.sharedRouter().open(""users/16"");
    // starts a new NewUserActivity
    Router.sharedRouter().open(""users/new/Clay/94303"");


#[android-router](https://github.com/trikita/android-router)
Example Setup

    ActivityRouter.getDefault()
        .add(""/splashscreen"", SplashScreenActivity.class)
        .add(""/login"", LoginActivity.class)
        .add(""/profile/:userId"", ProfileActivity.class);

To navigate to an activity

    ActivityRouter.getDefault().route(mContext, ""/profile/"" + mUserId);

To grab parameters out of the url

    String userId = getIntent().getStringExtra(""userId"")


This particular library also handles routing deeper into nested views.

    public class MainActivity extends Activity {
        ViewRouter mRouter = new ViewRouter(this);
        ...
        mRouter
            .add(""/splashscreen"", SplashScreen.class)
            .add(""/login"", LoginScreen.class)
            .add(""/profile/:userId/..."", ProfileScreen.class); // note the ""..."" - it allows to nest view routers

        mRouter.route(String.format(""/profile/%s/general"", ""user1234""));
define the screen and reminder
    public class ProfileScreen extends ViewGroup {

        String userId; // will be set to ""user1234"" automatically
        String uriRemainder; // will be set to ""general""

        ViewRouter mPageRouter;

        ProfileScreen(Context c) {
            // Nested router will dispatch between certain view mounted inside the current one
            mPageRouter = new ViewRouter(findViewById(R.id.page_content))
                .add(""/general"", ProfileGeneralView.class)
                .add(""/general"", ProfileGeneralView.class);
        }

        @Override
        public void onAttachedToWindow() {
            super.onAttachedToWindow();
            mPageRouter.route(this, uriRemainder);
        }
    }
This particular library seems to be handling the URI remainder. This seems like a promising strategy, has anyone done something like this?


#[AndRouter](https://github.com/campusappcn/AndRouter)
Declare routes via annotations

    @RouterMap({""activity://second"", ""activity://second2""})
    public class SecondActivity extends Activity {

        @Override
        protected void onCreate(Bundle savedInstanceState) {
            super.onCreate(savedInstanceState);
            setContentView(R.layout.activity_second);
        }
    }

Or via initializer

    Router.initActivityRouter(getApplicationContext(), new IActivityRouteTableInitializer() {
        @Override
        public void initRouterTable(Map&lt;String, Class&lt;? extends Activity&gt;&gt; router) {
            // only if the host is equal and pathes match, it matches.
            // The url ""activity://first/kris/26/birthday"" is one of the matches. ""kris"" and 26 are values of key ""name"" and ""age"". and the ""name"" value type is string, the age value type is integer.
            router.put(""activity://first/:s{name}/:i{age}/birthday"", FirstActivity.class); 
            router.put(""activity://second/:{name}"", SecondActivity.class);  
            router.put(""activity://third/home/:i{room1}/printdoor/:s{color}"", ThirdActivity.class); 
            router.put(""activity://four/buy/:s{name}/:f{price}"", FourActivity.class);                           
        }
    });

navigate

    private void openSecondActivity(){
        Router.open(""activity://second/汤二狗"");
    }

grab parameters

    public void getTheValueOfName(){
        String name = getIntent().getStringExtra(""name"")
    }

Even get results from activities

    private void openSecondActivityForResult(){
        ActivityRoute activityRoute = (ActivityRoute) Router.getRoute(""activity://second/汤二狗"");
        activityRoute.withOpenMethodStartForResult(this, 200).open();
    }


I would like to know existing Conductor patterns that solve the above use cases.

I think hydrating a controller through it's constructor instead of through intent extras allows for more type safety and a cleaner api experience. I'm curious to see if something like this is leveraged in some more advanced Conductor patterns.

This game will feature no ads, and will not monetize in any way, except for a small ""donate"" button which will link to a donation page on Paypal.

This I understand, but it also said that Google's in-app purchasing function does not allow for one-time payments, such as donations.

Was there an error in evaluating my app? After all, Google's policy only mentions using third-party payment mediums for *purchases*, not donations.

Or is there not a way to set up a donation function at all? That doesn't seem right, but that may be how it is...

713,Employer refuses to follow Android guidelines and instead opts for iOS-first; is there anything I can do?,"I just started working as an Android developer in a small company (3 people, me, iOS dev, backend dev). 

The way we're developing our project right now is that the CEO gives his plan to our iOS dev, who has seniority and has been around longer. The dev then designs iOS wireframes. I'm expected to follow them to a T. As a result, my work often ends up taking a lot longer to complete because I'm trying to figure out how to implement iOS functionality and often times it looks/performs at a sub par level because I'm avoiding typical Android design. Is there anything I can do to convince the CEO to let me alter design to conform to Android standards or am I SOL?

803,noob needs help with picture app,"Hey guys,

I've been doing android development for about 5 days now, and I'm trying to do something that is probably simple, but that has got me quite stumped.

The entire thing is essentially just part of a proof of concept for a larger project, but I'm trying to emulate an app that would take pictures, and send them to a server (seems simple enough).

I have a few constraints though:

- I'd like this to be free since I'll be only using it for a couple more weeks.
- I want to use my laptop as the server host. I'll be manipulating the images, and for that I'll need them on my laptop.
- I need to take the pictures with the app, in real time, not send them from gallery, if possible.

I've been following a lot of android tutorials, including a lot that do things similar to what I've been doing, but nothing exactly the same.

Some recommend using WAMPP for the server, which I can't use because Ubuntu (and there is way less documentation on LAMPP).

The best tutorial I've found is a bit more than half a year old, and a lot of the methods are deprecated: (HttpParams and stuff). I've found an apparent workaround (adding "" useLibrary 'org.apache.http.legacy' "" in my app build.gradle) but the methods are still crossed out in Android studio.

Most of the tutorials I've found send pictures from the Gallery, and don't take them, but I've seen some that do, so I assume I'll be able to mix and match what I learn to do so.

Here are the things I've been using/finding useful:

- Things by this guy (very helpful, but deprecated stuff):

- This here:
https://developer.android.com/training/camera/index.html
- This helped with the deprecation:
http://stackoverflow.com/questions/30856785/how-to-add-apache-http-api-legacy-as-compile-time-dependency-to-build-grade-fo
- Found this, but didn't yet use:
https://github.com/yushulx/JavaHTTPUpload
- This:
http://androidlift.info/2016/01/07/android-camera-image-capturing-and-uploading-to-php-server/


I've also been told to use ngrok, which should help with the server stuff.


With all of this, I'm having a few problems.


Could anyone point me in the right direction?

814,The proper way of handling config changes,"Let's say I have a use a case where the user clicks a button and sends a POST request. I don't want to lose the response when he rotates the phone. 

From what I've gathered the possible solutions are:

- Loaders - use them to encapsulate my REST models. A bit of ceremony until you set things up.
- Retained fragments - encapsulate my background work in a fragment (with no views) that gets retained across config changes. Correct me if I'm wrong, but this seems too dirty - how do I reference the retained fragment from my original fragment?  
- onRetainCustomNonConfigurationInstance() - override this method and retain my model. Appears to be the most straightforward solution, but not available for fragments, only activities.

Are these the only options? Please give some advice on how you tackle this issue.

I've found both free generators and paid ones. It seems risky to use a free generator and paying yearly or hiring a lawyer is a bit overkill since i'm not expecting much income from this game.

843,What role an android Service should play in the MVP pattern?," 0
down vote
favorite
	

I am developing an android app that does Human Activity Recognition. It basically works like that - Service constantly reads the accelerator data and stores the recognized activity (i.e. Walking, running) in a database. The user can see all of the recognized activities in an list View in activity (accesses the database). Every User table in the database has a pa_goal (physical activity goal) field which the Service reads from the database and does some checks. The user, of course, can change this goal from an activity. Since I will be implementing the MVP architectural pattern, I am unsure where to put the Service? It surely not View. Any advice, please! :)

845,I'm trying to get hired as an android dev. and I need your help,"I just graduated college in December (comp. sci) and I was complacent with my job search all the way through so I'm without a job at the moment (I know, my fault).

I didn't have any internships during school, and I only have one project under my belt - it's an Android app on my GitHub and it's really not at a professional level at all, though I suppose it's better than nothing.

I've been firing off applications for entry level Android developer positions, and it seems like all jobs require 3+ years experience (as they put it) and apps that are published on the play store (which I don't have yet). I'm assuming companies are taking one look at my resume and binning it since my experience is so lacking.

I'm also still trying to learn a  lot of the important technologies (RXJava, Dagger, Testing frameworks) so it will be difficult for me to incorporate them effectively until I get better at them. I'm not sure how important that is for an entry level job yet.

I'm trying to figure out what the most effective use of my time is for catching recruiters' eyes at this point. Should I simply focus on getting something onto the play store? It will take me a while to get my GitHub app ready for the play store, so I was thinking I could make another simple app in the mean time to get on there.

Any advice for moving forward would be appreciated, as I don't want to end up wasting more time than I already have.

854,App visibility part 2,"Yesterday I received some advice about app visibility and was hoping to follow up before making any changes. I am currently still unable to find my app anywhere except by package name search.

One user suggested that ""I had the same issue with one of my apps. It wound up being because the package name was different than the app name. I renamed the package and re-published the apk (as a ""new"" app) and was then able to search for the app as the #1 or #2 on the search list.""

We have been advertising for a week now and preferably would like to avoid uploading an entirely new app. However, if anyone can lend some additional advice here, that would be very helpful. Would there be a substantial benefit to uploading with a more specific package name?

My second question is a little more basic. Does GooglePlay use the title of my app to index at all? I have been told that is likely too far down the list of 250+ results to show up. Is there any way to check to see if the app is actually in the results at all, say even 500+ down the list? It's sort of annoying that the results just stop at some point leaving me with no idea as to if search is working properly. I can't for the life of me imagine why google is doing things this way.

857,Best way to mark data as uploaded?,"Hello, new Android developer here.

I'm building an app that will upload data to the server. This data will include stuff from the Content providers, like contacts, text messages, call logs, etc. I have ContentObservers registered that trigger the data upload as soon as it there is a change in content.

However, I've noticed that the ContentObserver gets called multiple times. For this reason, the app uploads the same data multiple times.

I'd like to have an option to somehow flag a specific call log or a specific message and say that it has already been uploaded, so that the next time the app is going through the list of all calls/messages, it removes the ""already uploaded"" one from the ""need to upload"" list. 

What is the best way to do this? Use a database and mark the objects there? Use SharedPreferences? Something else?

This morning I have been scouring the interwebs for information on file encryption and have found that there are incredibly many way to do things. I'm looking for some guidance/best practices on securely saving information on the users device.

My case is the following: my app will receive a media file from the server, which the user should have access to, but which they should not be able to pull off of the app to distribute themselves. It is comparable to songs on Spotify. 

I have found that I should probably encrypt the file using AES, simply because that is what everyone seems to be advocating. Beyond that, however, I am slightly lost: how can I keep (media) files accessible to users with access, yet safe from distribution by said user?

895,Two very different job offers,"Background: I finished my CS degree about 8 months ago, and since then have been working full time for a university as the sole developer of an interesting android application. The job has been enjoyable and fun, working with great people for extremely poor pay. The application in question is reasonably simple from a dev point, but quite revolutionary from a science point, and the team of Professors and post docs is in talks with Google, Carnegie Mellon and other well know organisations to help build it out. The money was running out and they were not sure what would be happening so I started looking for a new job.

Now: Went to three job interviews with well known companies for android dev roles, got rejected by 2 (liked me but not quite enough experience), and got offered an android SDET role at another big company ( &gt;$10 billion market cap). I was not really looking for SDET, but the team seems really good, lots of mentoring and a boss that believes in telling you what needs to be done and letting you do it without much micro management. Plus 100% salary bump (90k). I have verbally accepted this offer (yesterday), but as yet have not signed anything ( job is in Seattle if that makes any difference, I live about 6 hours away and plan on moving).Today the university team contacted me and said that because of the interest in their work they had managed to secure research funding, and can offer me a full time role at around 70k. 

My thoughts: As a new developer, I believe I am pretty good at working out how to get things working, but having a proper old hand to mentor me would be good for my knowledge progression. Whilst I can make things work, there is possibly much better ways I could be doing things, which is where working with people with &gt; 5 years experience would help. On the other hand, people, and HN, seem to suggest that going down the SDET path can be career limiting. 
Also, if I stay at the university, I would be working alongside well known names in machine learning that are using the data the app gathers to solve hard problems that have long been thought to be insolvable, but new technology is making (maybe) solvable. Note I have no experience in ML other than a 4th year AI subject, but would love to learn more on my own time, and think that is something I could probably do.

Is it worth not moving to earn 20k less a year, plus break my word to company offering SDET role? Or should I look for a pure SDE role somewhere else? Any thoughts appreciated on what would be better for my career long term. Thanks everyone.

Google gets you used to using and editing the manifest file.  Then when it tells you must increment the version code in order to update your app, well, naturally, you go to the manifest and there it is.

I can't even begin to tell you how many times I have incremented this, built an APK, uploaded it to the store, just to have it tell me I didn't increment.

Currently I'm working on a new hobby project where I need to keep a realtime connection between a back-end server and my Android app with preferably as less overhead as possible.

My idea:
I was thinking of having a plain tcp-socket connection between my server and app, creating my own protocol, handler, pool, etcetera.

All of these phrases include this icon, all green thumbs up!

http://www.androidpolice.com/2016/08/14/google-testing-top-features-play-store-app/

After spending around a year developing an app for this platform,  I have to say, I have no idea what the fuck google is spending their time on..

It's been around 2 weeks since I published my app to google play and I still am unable to find it with ANY search terms but the package name. We have advertised, optimized the page for GooglePlay, and have at least 200 users (because we include a QR code direct to the app in our ads, thankfully) Fucking candy crush shows up in a search for my app even though they share NOTHING in common. What is the point of developing an app for Android if google play fails to make it accessible to users in a simple SEARCH. 

I guess what I'm wondering is if developers at Google are like rats in a cage. I had a rat once who would constantly rearrange the scraps of paper in his cage, for seemingly no reason at all, and I'm wondering if this is just going to be the norm for the future. Google is constantly talking about ""improving algorithms"" but would it hurt to just design an app store that works and leave it the fuck alone? Yes! I know I shouldn't expect my new app to return a top search result, but honestly, what is the fucking hold up? What are they working on over there? Is it this hideous ""top features"" section? I have uploaded apps to the IOS app store with zero issues. It works like this: Step one: upload your app. Step two: search for your app and find it. 

Is google just going to continue to change its algorithms and add and remove features from the app store FOREVER? I came to this platform because people have been touting it's superiority for years but honestly I am not getting that feeling AT ALL from the Google play store... it just feels like they're fucking shit up simply because they ran out of things to do, and that's really not cool.

972,Where do you store your encryption keys?,"The state of Android seems to highlight that it's a very hard task so I wanted to see what others were doing. 

I'm trying to encrypt my realm database, easy to generate an encryption key, but where do you store it?

A few things I've come across after some research:


* Can't store in SharedPrefs because that can be accessed via adb
* Can't store in Keystore because bugs with it mean it'll be wiped if a user changes their phones unlock code, or adds a new fingerprint.
* Can't ask for a password on app open each time because app it's another password for the user to remember, and a blocker to using the app where I don't need it. Adds a lot of UI complexity. Database encryption doesn't need to be user facing

I thought the keystore would have been perfect, it generates the key and saves it. The key is never in your code. However all the bugs associated to it make it totally unusable. One day the key could not exist. Then what?

All of this has led me to one conclusion, I should have my server create and store my encryption key. Sounds all well and good, just need to ensure that the communication between me and the server is secure. Maybe by introducing certificate pinning.

So anyway, what do you do? I wanted a discussion because it seems to be a mess on Android. There are bugs reported on the tracker related to the keystore that haven't been touched in years, despite it being a matter of security. 

Is it just a lost cause on Android? Server or bust?

973,How do you behave with 'clones'?,"I have an API24+ app first published on Jun 27, 2016, the day the public N preview was released. 
The app has been developed against the preview so that few API changed, and few things broke during the early stages. 
After a while, and with the new platform getting more users, the app has been noticed and reviewed by few major blogs.
There are many other apps right now in the same area and this is fine and expected.
But last week I got an email from a user with a link to a recent app of the same kind.
Again, nothing wrong. But this app was curious:
- Same name, but with an N in front (nice try for the google indexing game!).
- Same color palette (let's confuse the users!).
- Almost same drawables (93%) (let's confuse the users even more!).
- Same logic to hide/show components at runtime.
- A particular feature slightly changed.

What would you do?
I contacted the 'developer' and he replied with arrogance and threads.
Then I wrote something on my social profile that actually moved few things.
I just want to know what others would do. Just a discussion.

Our designer uses these specifications when creating the mocks ups for our app, but recreating these in the actual app can be problematic, especially when it comes to the alignment and spacing between to elements.

 [Take for the example the layout metrics for cards](https://material.io/guidelines/components/cards.html#cards-content-blocks). All the vertical padding/margins on text is taken from the baseline of the text, something which (to my knowledge) isn't possible with normal TextViews

Horizontally aligning different types of views is also a common pain point with TextViews, Edittexts and Buttons all have different insets. I'm sure many of you have tried to align the left edges of TextView with the edge of and EditText below it. ([example](https://i.stack.imgur.com/nQbLD.png))

There doesn't seem to be any accepted, good solutions to deal with this. Manually adjusting all the margins/padding of every view is always an option, but time consuming. Automatically adjusting margins at runtime to counter this is also an option, but won't work for all cases.

I'm looking for some best practice advice, I hope that's allowed here. 

I currently have an app with quite a lot of different activities. On each activity, in the onCreate, I have toolbar related and font related code in every single activity and they're all the exact same code. I'm looking to replace that out with maybe a single method call per activity.  

As a workaround, I created a ""ToolbarManager"" class, which is empty, besides a single public static ""buildToolbar"" method where I pass in the activity, and set up the toolbar from there. I then call this from each activity to build the toolbar.  

What are the dangers of doing something like this?  
Is there a better way to implement a way to reduce the amount of repeated toolbar code?

1061,I want help in determining if this price quote too expensive,"I wanted a company to develop an app like uber. lets say for the sake of simplicity that it is uber but with a different product, it has some extra functionalities and a little bit more complicated. I asked the developers to develop the following:

Customer Side:
1- IOS Native
2- Android Native 
3- Web App (has full app functionality)

Operator Side:
4- Android Native

5- CMS Admin Panel (with alot of control over the app)

6- Landing website


The average price i had was around 60k. However, a friend of a friend (who apparently works in google) has heard that quote and said its overwhelmingly expensive. he said it shouldn't cost more than 15k at max and that i am being ripped off. 

I honestly am super lost, since I am not a developer and I am building a company and it is freaking hectic to know how this should be priced and what developer to choose to get a good price while also guarantee a good quality.

 I do not want to do it with free lancer coz i wouldnt trust the process. I have to mention that i got some prices around 20k, 30k but although they developed alot of apps they seemed too cheap to me.

I do not know what to do, my question is how really does an app like this cost ( according to my research on google it will cost minimum 100k) but according to my friends friend it should cost 10k. 

I am getting quotes starting from 
15k (only two)
40-70k (most of them)
200k and above (from companies like Savvy and big big corporations)

1074,Anyone else facing problems with integrating Google Vision API with their Android app?,"I've been an Android developer for quite some time now. One of my recent projects requires me to use (well, not compulsorily) the *Google Vision API* for certain features.

I've compiled Google Play Services to its latest version (v10.0.1), and the Google Face API as well (v10.0.1). Here's my build.gradle:

    compile 'com.android.support:appcompat-v7:25.1.1'
    compile 'com.android.volley:volley:1.0.0'
    compile 'com.google.android.gms:play-services-vision:10.0.1'

Here's my issue: The app is working perfectly on my phone. However, it isn't doing so on others. A lot of my friends amongst whom I distributed this application complained that they were getting a Toast displaying that the FaceDetector service was not available yet (I used the faceDector.isOperational() method).

They've tried rebooting their phones, updating Google Play Services to the latest version and even downgrading GPS so as to re-update it again, but to no avail.

Any suggestions/workarounds/permanent fixes? This problem is really unnerving, and I can't release my product of this.

1089,Legal action against my application after company changes hands,"Hello, 

I apologise if this isn't the best place for this (maybe a legal thread would be better) but I wanted to see if anyone had a similar experience as an Android Dev.

I created a radio streaming application for my neighbour two years ago. He was the director of the company at the time. 
Knowing him well (and knowing he didn't have enough funds to commission an application) I created one for him without any payment. I used it as a learning experience for myself.
Recently the company has changed hands (on bad terms from what I hear) and I received an email from the new directorate who has demanded access rights to the application and source code. He has also threatened legal action against me, on the grounds that he thinks I've been paid to do the work and they own the application. 

Does anyone know where I stand with this?
I'm planning on giving them access and handing things over, however it just all feels rather unfair.

I would like you give it a try and possibly fix some spelling errors, missing annotation or some other small issue to see if the process works.

1139,Meme = Sensitive Event Suspension on Play Store?,"Hi all,


Yes it is another suspended app/account termination thread.
So, i created an Harambe game a while back, yes i know that meme is dead but I was just starting to get into development with Unity3D and just wanted to share it. This game was basically a game where you dodge falling people while you are a Gorilla. 

As i saw hundreds of other Harambe apps on the Play store with 10 000 - 50 000 downloads, i decided to upload my own. My initial upload was Beta upload where no one could access besides myself. This upload was suspended. I had no idea why this was suspended but it was due to sensitive events. Through trial and error, i uploaded another one and another one which then led to my account being terminated. 
After being terminated i decided to finally file an appeal regarding this.

Here is the following responses from me and the google play dev ""support"" team.
http://imgur.com/a/k6diP

Is there any hope with a reply from the ""support"" team? It has been close to 3 weeks without a response. i filed another appeal but have not got any responses either. I am guessing my email is in some list that they ignore now?

1164,Android development feels more difficult than Windows desktop programming (.NET),"I've learned C#, Java and C++ and made small pieces of software for fun for the last 3 years. I always worked with Visual Studio.

Now I got into Android development and the learning process seems slow and difficult compared to desktop development. I just feel like I'm slow at learning it, not as quick as I was learning languages for desktop programming.

I'm intermediate at the languages I know for desktop programming. I know classes, optimization and all the basics, and have made tens of projects. I'm not an expert, but I'm definitely not a beginner either.

I work with Android Studio. No idea why it's harder for me, it's programming after all.

**TL;DR:** Android development (in Android Studio) feels difficult and not as obvious and intuitive as desktop programming in Visual Studio.

1180,Noob Question: How IntentService handles multiple clients calling same or different methods,"I have implemented Service (IntentService) using Developer's Guide, where it is stated that *If your service is private to your own application and runs in the same process as the client (which is common), you should create your interface by extending the Binder class and returning an instance of it from onBind().*

Now, I plan to write location, network codes, and other time consuming/blocking tasks in this service, allow public methods to be called from *onServiceConnected()*. There may be chance that location method can be called from multiple activities;

1. How the service entertains both calls, exclusively or not?
2. Does it runs different methods in parallel, like if Activity calls getLocation() and other Service at the same time calls fetchDataOnNetwork(), how the service behaviour will be?
3. Is there any queue management to these requests? 

In short what is **underlying logic** behind Bound Service?

For example can we trust Clutch.co?

1221,2017 Who's using Kotlin?,"Kotlin has been a slower pickup. The project is moving at a.. responsible.. pace. Even so, it's now a year since its prime-time release. Our team is starting to think about introducing it into our projects for some of the no-brainer use cases (data classes, lambdas, boilerplate reduction). It feels like a very organic pickup. As an Android team, we're getting really good vibes from the community and it doesn't feel like a rash decision. Nevertheless, there is still a lot of FUD around adopting it at an organizational level (management, recruiting, etc).

So, who's using Kotlin in their apps? It'd be great if you're willing to share where you work ([eero](https://eero.com/) here) but if not any testimonial will do.

1242,Google Cloud platform and Android Studio,"So Google has what would appear to be a rather nice suite of cloud services available for free to developers, and particularly of interest to me was the 1Gb git repo...  I *thought* this would be a great way to keep my source trees synched between my primary devel desktop and my laptop.

Except the documentation is *laughably* incomplete.  ...and I don't mean a jovial chuckle, I mean that I suspect rather sinister laughter and the word *""sucker!""* was involved as someone typed out the following four steps at [Using Cloud Source Repositories:]https://cloud.google.com/tools/android-studio/vcs

&gt; 1. In Android Studio, open the project you want to add to Cloud Source Repositories.
&gt; 2. Choose **VCS &gt; Import into Version Control &gt; Upload Project to Google Cloud**.
&gt; 3. In the displayed dialog, select the Google Cloud Platform Console project ID associated with the project.
&gt; 4. Click **Upload**.

In short, this *does not work*.  Creating the cloud project is straightforward enough, and creating the 'default' repo is actually documented elsewhere on the site but they leave out the (lol) minor step of installing the Google Cloud SDK, running `gcloud init` and changing git's credential.helper from ""manager"" to ""gcloud.cmd"".

To add insult to injury, once the above arcane elements are in place, AS appears to populate a not-very-useful .gitignore file which leaves what's in the repo in a state that can not be usefully imported into another instance of AS because important bits of gradle's config are completely omitted.

1258,[QUESTION] Do you guys have any difficulties with beta testing?,"There are two possible options:

1. You are running a beta testing program for the new application.
2. You are running a beta testing program for the application which has users already.

And there is a list of known problems:

- It is hard to find beta testers for the new applications.
- It is hard to find a targeted group of beta testers.
- It is hard to engage beta testers to leave a feedback.
- It is extremely hard to make them leave useful feedback (instead of spam or known issues).
- Sometimes, it requires a full-time position to manage a beta testing program.
- It is hard to get an overview of the past beta testing run. 
- It is hard to make sure that all necessary features and conditions were covered during the beta testing process.
- It is hard to track what was tested.
- It is hard to get an idea will users love new feature/app before actual implementation.
- It is hard to communicate something to beta testers.
- It is hard to create good user surveys to get a relevant information.

There will be more, but I hope we will figure it out.

Of course, there are cases when beta testing isn't necessary but in the same time, it can give your product a lot off benefits. New users, fresh ideas, quality improvements, additional data for analytics etc.

1271,Azure Notification Hub Installations (not Registration),"I recently ran into a multiple-day headache trying to implement push notifications for an Android app based on the Azure platform. The [official documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/notification-hubs/notification-hubs-android-push-notification-google-fcm-get-started) uses the concept of **registrations**. This worked fine to be able to send test pushes, but our backend used something called an installationId, which I could find no way to get. Turns out they have [two similar but incompatible sets of APIs](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/notification-hubs/notification-hubs-push-notification-registration-management), and the newer recommended one is not in the Android SDK (which seems out of date in general).

The REST API needs to be used directly along with a SAS token, and though this code wasn't hard to write, it was a bit difficult to work out what code needed to be written. The installationId is a locally-generated UUID that is provided to both the Azure API and the backend server (to target direct push notifications).

I really hope I can save someone else the trouble I went through with this gist of the code needed to get it working: https://gist.github.com/mensly/989e4005a7970e68fd5c8da4a4e079f9",1489520609.0,2017-03-14 19:43:29,1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/androiddev/comments/5sr0in/azure_notification_hub_installations_not/

One of the most difficult things is to share my screen without any lag.  iOS has really great ability to stream directly from the phone via cable and they also have a really fast simulator that runs extremely smooth.  

I have used the chromecast and it's just extremely finicky and hard to share without a dedicated TV screen hooked up to the chromecast.  Also I work with people that are remote so being able to use my PC is the easiest option for screenshare over Skype. 

Also, I do my development on a laptop and emulators are extremely finicky and laggy.  At least, Android's native and have never had good experience with GenyMotion in the past.

Anybody have any suggestions?

TL;DR: Looking for a way to stream to my PC to better demo work done for Android apps.  Chromecast, Emulators (Native Android and GenyMotion) aren't solving the issue because of lag and inability to stream effectively over my PC.",1489520680.0,2017-03-14 19:44:40,31.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/androiddev/comments/5sr58r/looking_for_a_way_to_stream_my_screen_directly_to/

Topics like rx, di mv* are really popular recently. There are many blog posts, videos, samples etc but they are usually missing things like proper handling config changes. These patterns are more for developers than for users.
So I'm looking for open source apps that are done as much as possible by the book. What I mean by that is for example: properly handling activity/fragment/view lifecycle, registering and deregistering things in proper callbacks, respecting low memory conditions, saving state and resuming even if system killed the app while it was in background, properly handling animations, clearing listeners so there are no memory leaks, being friendly to battery and ram consumption etc. etc.

1300,APK corrupted - appears not to have any of changes in it for the current build but the manifest changes are included. Help me troubleshoot.,"We did a release from our integration branch using a Git Flow technique (create temporary release branch, uplift version numbers, merge into master, tag, upload to Play Store) and soon afterwards realised that our fixes didn't seem to work. As part of the troubleshooting we rebuilt from our tag we created and tested this again. Suddenly our fixes worked.

We then downloaded the APK from the Play Store Developer console and loaded that onto a device and saw the same errors we saw previously. The troubleshooting build and the Play Store build were both built from the same tag in Git so we assume they must be identical.

We've been racking our brains as to how this could happen? Is there any tools / techniques that you would recommend us to follow to get to the bottom of this?

p.s. I know I know I know........ test it more before release. That goes without question. I was thinking more along the lines of how we can track down what went wrong rather than how to mitigate future occurrences.

So now I'm stuck updating two duplicate code bases. I'm always attempted just to abandon a paid app but maybe a couple of thousand people have purchased it over the last few years. Is this something that they should just suck up or is there a better way to handle this like merging the code bases.  If that is very complicated I really don't have time to do that.

Downloads for the paid app are at a crawl now compared to the in-app purchase.  Also, I hate to lose positive reviews if I dumped the paid app, but those may just be casualties of war.

1349,Just got offered my first job as an Android &amp; iOS developer. Is the salary too low?,"So, I started teaching myself to how to programme around 27 months ago. 

Since then I've developed a weather app for Android and a multi-OS social network that is available for download on both iOS and Android. 

I've got a good amount of experience with HTML, CSS and JavaScript and built 2 websites for a company. I also built a landing page for my social network but it's been a while since I did a lot of web development. And, I can programme for both Android &amp; iOS apps.

The salary I got offered was £35000(in London UK).This would be my first job as a programmer for a software development company but I have been working for myself for over 2 years.

Is this salary too low or higher than what I could expect for my first job as a programmer? I've seen that the average salary for both Android and iOS developers is roughly £35000 but as someone who can programme for both platforms and has experience building websites perhaps my market salary could be expected to be a little above the average salary for someone who only develops for iOS or Android. 

Any advice would be much appreciated. 

Thanks in advance.

1353,Use gyroscope sensor with Arduino to use on Android phone,"Last Christmas, I got myself a VR-Box for my phone, only to find out my phone's internal gyroscope doesn't work. I googled for solutions but couldn't find anything.
Now, about a month later, I've taken some lessons about Arduino and stuff like that and I was wondering whether I'd be able to connect a sensor, like the MPU-6050 to an Arduino Uno and then send the data from the sensor to my phone using either Bluetooth or a usb-cable.
I also found some articles about sending data from sensors to your android phone, like this one The only problem here is that it only shows the data from the sensor on the Arduino app, instead of actually using it as sensor data.
So I was wondering if I would be able to somehow make my phone think that the data coming in from the Arduino is actually coming from the internal gyroscope (which doesn't give any, since it's malfunctioning). I couldn't find an app that does this, but if there is, please tell me since it is probably a lot safer than if I were to have to make my own app, in which I have no experience at all.
Oh, and here are some details about my phone, if those are needed: Running Android 5.1, and I believe it's the custom UMI version, since my phone is from UMI after all. The phone contains a gyroscope, but it doesn't actually measure anything, only returns a data of 0, even if I move the phone. The phone is rooted, maybe that could come in handy to make my phone read the arduino data as the internal sensor data. If you need any other specs about my phone, please PM me :).

I'm currently developing a game, and want to add something along the lines of a lever swinging down from the side of the screen.

Now, the lever itself I can create with RectF. That's no big issue - but I also want it to be able to detect collision while in the rotation.

Can someone recommend a way to go about doing this? As far as drawing it, I'd imagine just canvas rotate - but what about collision detection?

Thanks for any ideas. SO searches keep finding recommendations to use AndEngine, but AndEngine looks all but abandoned based off of their forums (spam infested) and the last commit date of a few years ago.

I'm open to other engine suggestions, but would really prefer to do this as much as possible without extra libs, since this is also a project I'm doing to teach myself Java/App development/Game development.

1388,"How to update ""main"" dataset of my app from other fragments","I'm creating a  new thread, and not a post @weekly_questions thread cause I think what I ask may interest others too.

I have one Activity and many Fragments. 
One of those fragments is the ""main"" (the one user sees when he enters the app ) 
and it's supposed to be the main view of the app, is the TimelineFragment with users posts (image/number of likes/number of comments/details)

When there's a change i.e. user clicks ""like"" button it's fearly easy to update it (with notifyDataSetChange())  
The problem starts when user is in another Fragment, lets say a ProfileFragment and from there opens user's posts
and ""likes"" some post - if this post is on the timeline I have to update the number of likes .
 
What I do is from there ( UsersPostsAdapter ) I use Otto event but to notify MainActivity about the change,
I use `TimelineFragment timelineFragment = (TimelineFragment) getSupportFragmentManager().getFragments().get(0);`
to get a reference to  `TimelineFragment` ( cause its always the first fragment to the list of Fragments ) 
and I call a method `timelineFragment.updateNumberOfLikes(id)`. And since the dataset is stored in Adapter this
last method calls `adapter.updateNumberOfLikes(id)` where I alter the value of ""likes"" variable for the id
and I find the position of this id in the dataset so I finally call `notifyItemChanged(itemPos)`. 

I just think that it doesn't feels a very good approach - too many components interact with each other for just updating a 
single value from my main dataset.

Forgot to mention that I use https://github.com/ncapdevi/FragNav library with a bottomBar so I can keep 
four different stacks of Fragments -  where the current fragment gets detached when there's another one
pushed on top of it.

I don't know if a database could be a solution for this case and I'd like to ask how you deal with such
things. Sounds to me as an overkill to use a database, since at least for me, it is mainly used for persistence of data
when for example user navigates away from the app and comes again some hours/days later.  
Maybe there is a better solution I haven't even thought about it ? While I have a very basic understanting of RxJava
I think I have see some posts where someone creates an `Observable` ""watching"" the database table for changes. (or I could be wrong) 
Is this something that may apply here as well ?
Or maybe what I'm doing is right cause that's the android way and I just have to deal with that?

1400,Generic FragmentStatePagerAdapter,"Hey guys,

I've created many `FragmentStatePagerAdapter` subclasses across my android projects and they always end up very very similar i.e `getItem` instantiates the fragments with a bundle arg and the rest is pretty much boilerplate.

I'd like to slim down this process to a single generic `FragmentStatePagerAdapter`. To this effect I'm currently using the pasted class below.

Do you guys have any suggestions for improvement? I know the `Constructor` section is a little... sketchy -  I wanted to avoid passing around references to fragments from the activity/fragment that instantiates this adapter so I'm passing the fragment `Class` through and letting the adapter do it internally.

Come in and share some opinion!,"I have not exactly finish building an app before, the last one was a final year project and was abandoned not long after submitting it. Am on a new idea now, doing prototyping and testing all the api and firebase, stuffs I would be using.
I felt like my progress is really slow, compared to how I started that school project app. The method was different in starting the app though.

&amp;nbsp;
  
In my first app, I drew out the specs and requirement and then the app layout and screens then I start to build them. I got started on the app building pretty quick.
In my current app idea, I drew out the specs and requirements just as usual, but then I did not go into the layout and screen design yet. I went to test the api and stuff, and it's taking awhile and at times I don't even feel like touching the work. Am feeling like I am stuck in a rut.
  
So i was wondering if whats your method of building an app that I could try out :)

1418,Using a database like sqlite to save player/team data in a sports sim app,"Hey guys, I'm not sure if this question is simple enough that it belongs in the weekly questions thread or not. If it is, I can just copy and paste this question over there, but I'm trying to wrap my head around the most efficient way to implement a database in a sports sim game that I'm working on for android.

Currently in the app, the user can pick a team to coach, sim through their schedule, change their lineup, and look up their players' stats as the season goes along. There's no save feature yet so I thought saving all the player stats, team rosters, etc could be implemented with a database. 

Right now when a user picks a team, I have a league object that generates all the team objects that in turn have player objects. I'm trying to wrap my head around all of the things I'll have to change in my app with a database. I guess when I generate the league, I'd be doing a lot of writing to the database (teams, players, etc) and then when the user quits and starts up the app again, I'd have to read all that data in and re-create all of the league, team, and player objects? Does that sound like the right way to go about it? I feel like I'm kind of rambling but I don't have much experience at all with using databases with an extremely object oriented app like this.",1489536120.0,2017-03-15 00:02:00,0.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/androiddev/comments/5tlwrw/using_a_database_like_sqlite_to_save_playerteam/

1454,How do you configure Dagger2 + OkHttp3 + Retrofit2 for multiple simultaneous network APIs?,"My intent is to try various free network APIs simultaneously. Say TMDB, trakt.tv, whatever... The problem is that different APIs require different OkHttp interceptors for authentication, api keys, different GSON setup, different retrofit converters but they normally share a common `OkHttpClient` and `Retrofit` instances. So the OkHttp dagger module must know in prior all used apis and their configurations. This results in one big `NetworkModule` and that's a poor modularity. I know I can do it with one `OkHttpClient` and `Retrofit` per api service but that doesn't feel right. I wish to end up with a more modular setup, easier to add or remove apis. Like ""one dagger module per api"" style, do you know if that's possible in a clean way? 
Or is it a bad practice to have multiple http clients and retrofit instances?

EDIT: A mistake. Retrofit instances are per-API, always. Cannot be shared between apis.",1489539675.0,2017-03-15 01:01:15,6.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/androiddev/comments/5tstav/how_do_you_configure_dagger2_okhttp3_retrofit2/

1456,"Planning on attending the NYC Android Developers meetup, just looking for some advice","I posted this over in [/r/cscareerquestions](https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/5ttivl/planning_on_attending_the_nyc_android_developers/) also, but I wanted to leave it here as well

I'm a fairly recent grad (2013) who has been working in insurance IT doing SQL development for about 3 years now. I'm looking for a change and I'd really like to get into Android development. I've been doing as much as I can on the side, I just completed Udacity's intermediate level course and am hoping to start on my own app.

Anyways... What I really want to do is move to NYC. I live in Connecticut, so I'm not super far. I was planning on attending the [android developer meetup](https://www.meetup.com/nyandroiddevelopers/) this week, and potentially keep going regularly. This would be my first time attending any sort of meetup and I don't have a ton of experience with networking events. I realize these meetups are the kinds of places people go to talk to other experienced developers and I'm not that. So I guess my question is, how do I best approach this as someone who has no real experience with Android, and is looking for a job? What I'd really like to do is talk to as many people as possible and hear about their work and their day-to-day. I'd like to get a better idea of the ""scene"" and stuff like that. Do you think this would be welcomed at this meetup? I'm not a fan of networking and just walking up and talking to people out of the blue, so this will be difficult, but it's something I want to be able to do.


Also, I know it's a long shot, but has anybody gone to these meetups before? Is anyone going to the one this week and might want to get together and chat?

I'm new to android development but happy with my modest progress so far and loving it.

1469,Creating a mini-syllabus to learn Android development in a short amount of time.,"Hi guys. I have a project to create an Android app at college and only have about 7-8 weeks to do it. The app idea itself isn't too complicated so I don't think it would be that hard to implement. It's essentially a diet-tracking type thing, think generic lifestyle/self-improvement app. There's no networking involved. Just some database work and generic coding. I've been looking at different online courses and I essentially need to pick just a few that cover as much ground as possible. From what I've researched I need to know Java and then Android studio. I already know how to program but not in Java however I have used C# in the past which I've heard is similar. I understand that even if I go through some courses I'm going to need to do a lot of Googling to hack the app together. 


Would anyone be able to make a small syllabus for me from online courses that would cover what I would need to make this app? I've been looking at the Google Udacity courses however I'm not sure whether they cover Java. I'm essentially a little worried that I might undertake one of these courses online and then realize three weeks in that it doesn't cover all the grounds I need.

1479,[N00B-Q] RxAndroid and half-synchronized data,"The use-case is as follows: 

~~I'm making the app that will communicate with different systems (3rd party) and collect some data.~~

~~I want the exact copy of that data on my device, but I also want to be able to put extra (""offline"") data in my storage (and not share it back to 3rd party systems).~~

~~So, I have a database (ORM/realm, SavedPreferences... doesn't matter ATM) that has ""live"" and ""offline"" data in it. ~~

~~""Live"" data are records that need to be synchronized with the 3rd party (they might process them and change statuses), and offline data is my personal Data I use for analysis.~~

~~What I need is UI bound to database, and database to be periodically refreshed from the internet (auto-refreshing once a day would be enough or on user request/submit action to the 3rd party system). ~~

~~There will be many different providers with their own data (some are JSON, some would have to be parsed form HTML.... lots of reverse engineering), so I'd have to provide maps for all their data.~~

~~Now, I was thinking about RxObservables, and I was thinking about some kind of Event handling (encapsulate event, like ""dataset changed"") to produce data stream in Rx, but I don't know if this is the right approach.~~



I come form C# world and this is my ""Hello World""/personal project, and already I'm missing delegates :) 


What's the best way to connect data (CRUD operations) to UI?

EDIT: 
-----

**Simplified use case:** 

Have you seen [Google Keep](https://keep.google.com/)? It's a simple web app that lets you put some notes and share them with other users. 

OK, now imagine an app that lets you make notes locally, but some of those notes would end up in ""cloud"" for other people to see and edit (and you'd have to be able to get notified someone changed something), while other notes are private for you and they live only in your local storage (database/file.....). 

I don't want storage/repository to be only a cache for cloud repository, but a mixture of local data only and synced data. 

So, CLOUD has api to query for all notes and to publish notes/update if it's some other people's notes. 

I'm asking question about architecture here to make UI responsive. 

Should I use MVP, or should I use ""MVO"" (just coined that expression) where instead of Presenter I have Observables. 

What's the data flow (e.g. sync-ing local storage/repository), how to wire it with UI (two-way communication). 

I actually would like to know ""best practices"" for something like this not to end up in *Callback hell* ?

I dunno, I **like** the nav drawer. I don't see why people hate it so much. It's just odd how we're ""fixing it"" by merging iOS design patterns in and erase any indication of that it isn't a platform-specific.

Considering this is more a UX question if anything, and in fact it's more of a rant than a question, hopefully this isn't too off-topic.

1525,confused about development and code layers,"Hi, I've been going through /r/androiddev for about an hour now and I'm hoping someone can clear something up for me.

So I know most Android apps are written in java.  Which means that the app on the phone, was written in java.

But, is the API another layer that exists on a server some where? 

I hear people talk about Python[Django], .NET[c#], Java with Spark, Java with Ninja Framework, etc...are these the languages people are using to write their API layer?

From what I gather, the API is the layer of code that contains the business logic/data manipulation logic and it is between the database and the actual app.  Is that correct?

So the app also needs code to communicate with the API in addition to code that handles all the displaying of data to the user, interacting with the user, etc...

Does that make sense?

There argument is why build something from scratch and pay lots of money while its already out there, first of all I am not sure how will they assess the code but they said that this is their job.

There offer is very attractive as they offer a fraction of how much it would have cost me if I went from scratch?

What do you think of such options? What are the advantages and disadvantages? From your experience is it good/possible for a coder to get a clone code and customize it?

Customization will include things like price logic, user flow, and some added functionalities.

1560,Google play not indexing android app title change,"I changed my app's title and description from the google play console a little less than 24 hours ago in hope of targeting a keyword with significantly higher traffic.

However, If I append my developer name to the search query or put the new title in quotes """" it shows up. 

This has left me thoroughly confused since I'm not if google has indexed the new title and description - In which case my app should have appeared somewhere in the search query, be it at position 90 or whatever. Also my app no more ranks for its old title if that helps.

problem is is this even a thing? like can you write up an app concept or design an app on paper and sell the idea? or could you copywrite an app and then offer it to someone if they would be willing to give you credit or something or is that not a thing?

1607,Question about polling sensors,"Hey guys,

I'm an Android beginner and I've recently started working with my phone's on-board sensors. I'm trying to design an app that will poll certain sensors at regular intervals (say, every 500 ms) and plot the sensor values in real time using Android's canvas.

The problem is that I can't figure out how to set this up with Android's sensor API. Despite using a polling period of 500000 us (corresponding to 500 ms) when calling SensorManager.registerListener(), the callback onSensorChanged() is being called at irregular intervals (corresponding to when the sensor changes value), seemingly regardless of the initial polling period of 500000 us.

Rather than being alerted every time a sensor changes value, is there an Android-idiomatic way of asking the system to **poll this sensor every 500 ms, regardless of whether the value has changed or not**?

Alternatively, since Java has nice built-in facilities for executing tasks at regular intervals (Timer, TimerTask, etc.), I would even settle for being able to poll a sensor manually, so that I can schedule that task myself.

Any help here would be greatly appreciated!",1489563780.0,2017-03-15 07:43:00,9.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/androiddev/comments/5ut2qo/question_about_polling_sensors/

1610,Yet another Clean Architecture MVVM sample,"I've created small sample application with presentation logic based on MVVM. Key items to note:
-View Model exposes data throught Android databinding, not Rx. With such approach, View is mostly limited to xml layouts. Activities are almost empty.
-Custom binding adapter to expose complex data and handle custom listeners.
-View model survives orientation change by retaining the Activity component (Dagger2).
-All dagger2 dependencies are created via modules, no @Inject annotated constructors. However, all dependencies are fulfilled via constructors - for easier unit testing.
-Project is divided into 4 gradle modules. Data module does not have a direct dependency to Domain. Instead, both modules uses ""Databoundary"" module, which contains declaration of repository interface, and POJO classes. 

I already have some concerns:
-View models passes Rx Observer instance to the domain layer. It seems like a bit overhead. Every operation needs to register observer. E.g. Ask for last date, observe the result. When received, make anoter request, and observe the result, etc. I was wondering if returning an observables from domain layer wouldn't be a better idea.

The project is still in progress, so if you spot some flaws, or think something could be done in a better way, please do not hesistate to write. Feedback really appreciated!

1620,Starting an Android app using MVP architecture and going for a similar look to the OkCupid search page. Any libraries you'd recommend to achieve this?,"I want to make an Android app for the video game website giantbomb.com, they have tons of videos and I just would like to make a simple app to search and watch them on an android phone. This would be my first app outside of Udacity's Sunshine app.

I'm going for a look similar to that of the OkCupid app, specifically the search page. [Here is a screenshot](http://www.top100datingapps.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/okcupid-android-app-screenshot-3.jpg). I want to make this a list of videos with their thumbnails and small title/description. Are there libraries out there that can help me achieve this look? Is this something I can do with a default Android component?

Secondly, I have next to no experience using public API's. [This](http://www.giantbomb.com/api/documentation) is GiantBomb's API, is it even going to be possible for me to get the video thumbnail from this? I did a quick ctrl+f for ""thumbnail"" and got nothing.

My last question is related to MVP. I want to create this app using the MVP pattern and I'm at the point where I'm creating a type of ""VideoRepository"" class that will feed a list of videos to the presenter. Obviously I could do several things here, but I'm wondering what would make the most sense for this repository to return when it's ""getVideos"" method is invoked? Should it return a big string of video URLs for the Presenter/View to handle? Should it return a list of individual view objects (presumably what ever kind of viewholder object I use that is made up of the thumbnail, title, and description)?

1624,MVP Event Handling,"I'm using MVP(based on googlesamples) in my app but I don't know how to handle events that came from the background. The note app from googlesamples is too simple so it didn't cover this.

The app uses an iBeacon device and the View will be updated of the device's range. This ""range"" event(Within range/out of range) doesn't come from the user, this comes from the Bluetooth background scanning. 

My idea is to have a BeaconScanner class that scans this beacons from the background and also accepts BeaconRepository(Data Layer) as a constructor parameter to directly change the Beacon object from it and have my Presenter class listen to the BeaconRepository. This means that I will make my BeaconRepository class an Observable and my Presenter class an Observer. 

Is this a good way to implement it?
Is this testable?

What is the purpose of the @Nullable and the @NonNull annotations, I've seen them used in pretty much every project but never understood why, do they help the code analysis determine whether a function is able to return null? Warning if it can?


Secondly, if I have three fragments, A is a list, C is a item view and B is a fragment to add an item to the list. How do I make it so from A you can go to B, and then to C, then return from C to A by pressing back, like this: A -&gt; B -&gt; C -&gt; A. I've tried disallowing add to back stack as well adding it to the backstack as null but the result is B is moved to the start somehow. So if you then press back a load you end up on B.


Third and finally, is using a new thread and a handler an effective way of improving performance if I'm loading stuff from disk. Currently I start a thread that reads files from the phone then the handler updates the UI. Is this a correct method of doing this?

I wanted to ask how you guys are organizing, collecting, storing, gathering your analytics events (for Firebase Analytics, Fabric, or whatever) - or other things like A/B tests.

At the moment, we are storing them in a google spreadsheet, but that is getting out of hands with both length as well as organizational management. Ideally, I'd love to find a solution or service which lets me manage app-metadata with ease. 

For example for events, I'd need some sort of database to store the screen, maybe a short description of when the event should be fired, and of course the key and values / properties. All of this is at the momen stored in the spreadsheet, together with checkboxes (marking implementation status on our platforms).

We are also storing A/B tests in a spreadsheet, but here's the same problem - with more testing it just gets out of hand, but I don't want to delete / discard the information gathered (behavior of different variations, winning variation, conversion rates and user retention of each variation etc.).

I have been following the ""Refactoring an Android App Series"" that has been posted here, and I would like to ask something about the testing process.



* In my database I have a list of items, 
 
* In my View I have a RecyclerView that displays those Items.

* my Presenter calls the repo, get's all the data.does some processing on the data (like converting Date objects to strings.. etc...)

I decided to write some unit tests for the presenter.


how extensive should my tests be?

 I added a test for the general scenarios like success and failure.

also I added a check that indirectly tests a private function that does some string manipulation on the data..

 should I test that all the fields pass correctly? should I only check for the fields that I do some logic on.. or are the general success failure tests that all examples show are enough?

what about more complex Presenters? that deal with more complex views?

the guy in the video said that the tests help explain the code when you come back to it in the future.. but if i write too many tests.. the login will be as hard to follow as when I just read the original class.

Over a year ago I wrote a app for OnePlus's free phone contest (I didn't win :( ). I forgot the app was even in my play dev account all this time, I had bookmarks direct to the pages of my actually published apps. 

Earlier today I went and cleaned out a bunch of old apps by unpublishing them. Shortly after unpublishing the app from the OnePlus contest, I get a email from Google that my 'update has been rejected due to copyright infringement'.

This was a unpublish google, not a update. I wanted to **get rid** of the app. 

So now I'm stuck with a irritating notification in my console. I emailed their support team with a *strongly worded* email about **reading** before taking action. If they ignore me, I'll just submit a blank app overtop of it, then unpublish that.

I reiterate, google's dev support team is braindead.

**Edit**: I expect to be back within 72hrs with definitive proof that google does not even read our emails when they send back some canned response.",1489571689.0,2017-03-15 09:54:49,0.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/androiddev/comments/5v951j/googles_play_store_support_team_is_braindead/

I want to make it something more interesting than just a simple foolish app. I want to give control over development of it for reddit users. So I thought of approach that I named Reddit Driven Development.
I want you to put in comments ideas for next features. And in weekly updates the idea with most upvotes will be implemented.

App is open source under MIT license, so anyone can fork it or do whatever he wants to do. Also I'd really appreciate feedback on code quality as I'm still learning and it will definitely help me develop.

1715,Do you always look for the latest version of your dependencies?,"I'm starting an app, it'd be the first app I've created outside Udacity's intermediate course (not the nanodegree, just the one course) and I'm starting by using [this tutorial](https://adityaladwa.wordpress.com/2016/10/25/offline-first-reactive-android-apps-repository-pattern-mvp-dagger-2-rxjava-contentprovider/) because it basically hits the nail on the head in terms of the app architecture I want to use and libraries I want to learn.

Anyways... in the first step it has you adding your dependencies. The codes snippet is:
    //Retrofit
    compile 'com.squareup.retrofit2:retrofit:2.0.2'
    //OkHttp
    compile 'com.squareup.okhttp3:okhttp:3.2.0'
    compile 'com.squareup.okio:okio:1.7.0'
    
    //Gson
    compile 'com.google.code.gson:gson:2.6.2'
    compile 'com.squareup.retrofit2:converter-gson:2.0.1'
    
    //RxJava
    compile 'io.reactivex:rxjava:1.1.2'
    compile 'io.reactivex:rxandroid:1.1.0'
    compile 'com.squareup.retrofit2:adapter-rxjava:2.0.1'
    
    //StorIO
    compile ""com.pushtorefresh.storio:sqlite:1.9.0""
    compile ""com.pushtorefresh.storio:content-resolver:1.9.0""
    compile ""com.pushtorefresh.storio:sqlite-annotations:1.9.0""
    compile ""com.pushtorefresh.storio:content-resolver-annotations:1.9.0""
    apt ""com.pushtorefresh.storio:sqlite-annotations-processor:1.9.0""
    apt ""com.pushtorefresh.storio:content-resolver-annotations-processor:1.9.0""
    

I'm wondering if I should just use those versions, or should I go and check what the latest versions are for each? 

Then, when I'm maintaining the app should I be keeping up and updating the libraries when they release new versions? (I realize this is probably personal choice, but what's standard or ""normal""?)

Thanks for any advice!

=====================EDIT==================

Well, I might have answered my own question. When I copy that in and gradle sync I get the following error: 
    
    Error:(49, 0) Could not find method apt() for arguments [com.pushtorefresh.storio:sqlite-annotations-processor:1.9.0] on object of type org.gradle.api.internal.artifacts.dsl.dependencies.DefaultDependencyHandler.

I checked StorIO's github and it looks like all you need is:

    compile 'com.pushtorefresh.storio:sqlite:1.12.3'
    compile 'com.pushtorefresh.storio:content-resolver:1.12.3'

1754,Unit Test method naming conventions,"I am trying to write some unit tests for my `Presenter`.  These are the 4 methods in my `Presenter`

`void onLoadPopularMovies(int currentPage);`
`void onMovieClick(Movie movie);`
`void onScrollToEndOfList();`
`void onDestroyView();`

I know that each unit test will test exactly one code path in each of these methods and based on some talks on the subject there are 3 steps you want to complete in a unit test :
1. Set up conditions required for the test
2. Then perform one or more actions
3. Afterwards, verify that the state you are expecting is actually achieved

However, I am trying to come up with a good naming convention for my test methods.  Here are some I found :

methodName_codepathExplanation
methodName_StateUnderTest_ExpectedBehavior
methodName_InputValues_ExpectedBehavior
methodName_WithCertainState_ShouldDoSomething
methodName_WhenX_ExpectY

so for example the methodName could be `onLoadPopularMovies`.

1758,How to learn Visual and Interaction Design as a Software Enigneer?,"Hello @everyone,

I am a self-employed software engineer and as much as I love everything bits and bytes, I am pretty much at a loss when it comes to designing things... both from a visual and interaction design point of view. It is hard for me to figure out how much white space should be where, which colors go along with one another, what fonts are best, what line spacing, what object sizes... and so forth.

This naturally is a huge problem -- one that I would like to work on and improve since a good design is equally as important as a proper coding and architecture... no matter if its a desktop / mobile app or a web site.

Being a one-man shop, and also having a keen interest in design as well as 3d myself, this is definitely something that I want to do myself.

Unfortunately, it is hard to find good literature that is somewhat tailored to my needs and covers what I need. Right now I am considering ""Universal Principles of Design"" (978-1592530076) followed maybe by ""About Face: The Essentials of Interaction Design, 4th Ed"" (978-1118766576).

Generally I am looking for something that is practical, helps me build my skills that I can actually use and are relevant to me... and that is geared toward beginners that don't quite have an eye for design yet.

So I would like to ask for advice on any literature, online courses or whatever that could help me out.

Thanks,

We will subtract all refunds from developer payouts, not just those made within 48 hours of purchase. The Google Play Developer Distribution Agreement (""DDA"") will be updated to reflect this change in the coming months.""

Does this seem a bit ridiculous to anyone else. What's going to stop people from using apps or games for a few months until they're finished with them and then request a refund. 

The only way I can see this working is if Google puts in place some human intervention that ensures the request is legitimate as in the app no longer works for some reason. But given their track record with play support it seems really unlikely that's going to be the case. 

I also don't see how this will work if requests for refunds come in after Google has made a payout to a dev at the end of the month. Will you then owe Google money?

1813,Push Notifications vs Polling,"I'm kinda new to mobile dev, spend much more time on the platform/api side.  Can someone explain to me why you would use push notifications instead of using a background service to poll your own backend for updates?  

I know there is some concern about battery usage, but assuming that you weren't keeping a constant connection open and only polling every few minutes, why not?

For ex - the Foursquare app is obviously periodically beaming your location back to them in the background, and if you stay in one place long enough you'll get a notification saying ""Welcome to X!"" or something of the sort.  Are they using push notifications?  Seems like it would be easier to just respond to one of those requests with ""Hey you should notify the device with xxx"".  

Maybe you can't create a notification from an app that's running in the background?

1818,Dagger 2 updates (specifically for Android),"The newest Android Developers Backstage podcast had the tech lead for Dagger 2 on and he talks about some changes and advancements they've been working on for Android specifically (among other things like more general Dagger info, annotation processors, AutoValue and Guava).  

Most of the changes are available in the repo HEAD now (in the [dagger.android](https://github.com/google/dagger/tree/master/java/dagger/android) package as well as the [Android-specific docs page](https://google.github.io/dagger/android.html)) - he said they should be live in a new version release ""within weeks"".

Its basically a collection of generic activity and fragment-scoped components and modules that reduce a lot of the boilerplate of setting up injection in an Activity or Fragment, turning the dagger setup into a one-liner (Support fragments supported too).  Neat.

e.g. this:  

    ((SomeApplicationBaseType) getContext().getApplicationContext())
        .getApplicationComponent()
        .newActivityComponentBuilder()
        .activity(this)
        .build()
        .inject(this);

becomes this:   


    AndroidInjection.inject(this);

1826,"Does my app idea make sense, and where do I start? Thank you!","Hi!

My friends and I have wanted a workout app designed for the Five-Factor Workout for a couple years now. I have some extra time now, and I would like to learn how to code it. I'm not looking to make any money off it; I just want to make it for personal use. I drew a diagram of how I think it could work: http://imgur.com/IphKmbN. 

It's like flipping through an infinite flashcard deck where the cards update themselves. The program is twenty-five workouts grouped into five weeks, and I call doing the program once a ""cycle."" Each card would have an upper-right number that says the cycle you're on, so it starts at one, and every twenty-five cards, goes up one. The background of the cards changes every five cards (one color per week, so five colors). Then there's text listing the exercises. There are five sets of exercises, and each gets repeated five times in a cycle (for example, the Monday set will be repeated on each Monday but with different reps, sets, and rest times). There would be buttons to show what weight you used last time for this exact exercise set and for you to input what you use today, and the cards will update with this next time. There will be buttons to tick off each set you do, like a checklist, and there will be a countdown timer to click that times your rests. At the end, there's a Done button that you click to end the workout and close the app. Then the next day when you open the app in the gym, it opens to the next card.  

Do you think this is a reasonable app for me to make and where do I start? Is it designed correctly? I have no programming experience, but I have an Android phone, and my friends have iPhones.

1836,Shuttle Music Player is now open source! (x-post /r/Android),"Over the years, I've given thought to the idea of open sourcing Shuttle. I enjoy open sourcing stuff - it's nice to be able to show off what you can do, help others, and also get some help in return. It's also nice to give back - without open source, Shuttle wouldn't exist.

For those who don't know it, Shuttle is a local music player for Android. 

Check it out [Play Store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=another.music.player), or via the [website](https://www.shuttlemusicplayer.com)

It started off in early 2012 as a project to learn how to code. With some really positive feedback and encouragement from /r/Android, and as my skills developed it slowly picked up momentum, and became a relatively successful app (at least in my books), reaching around 4 million downloads, and earning ~$AU150k in its 4 years of life.

I'm really proud of what I've been able to do with the app. It's led to a job as a full-time app developer, and I now develop both iOS and Android apps full-time. 

It's worth noting though, that none of this was possible without open source, and help from the kind of people who love open source. When I was starting out, I discovered Apollo Music Player, and its developer, Andrew Neal. I sent him a bunch of emails asking how he managed to get around certain problems in the app. Although I considered the apps to be sort of in competition with one another, he couldn't have been more approachable and happy to help. Over emails, hangouts and eventually Slack, he ended up teaching me how to use Git, Eclipse (ugh), Java patterns, and tons more. Basically, he unwittingly and enthusiastically became a sort of mentor. It still surprises me to this day how someone can be so happy to take time out of their day just to show some random stranger on the internet how to do something. Yet, the same thing happens to me now, from time to time I'll get hit up on hangouts with someone asking how I solved a problem in Shuttle, and though it's not much effort for me, I always remember to pay it forward.

So, here's hoping that Shuttle can be to someone else, what Apollo was to me!

For developers:


Part of the motivation behind open sourcing Shuttle is also because I'd like to see the development move ahead a bit faster. In other words, I'm looking for **contributors**. So, if you're a beginner looking to get your hands dirty, or there's just that one feature that's lacking, and you think you know how to solve it, please feel free to give it a crack. Open an issue or make a pull request.

I don't have as much free time as I used to, and I also find that one of the downsides to working full-time as an app developer, is I'm less enthusiastic about writing code late into the night. Also, weirdly, the better I get at coding, the higher my standards are, and the *longer* it takes me to get things done.

I'm still actively developing Shuttle though, and I'll try to be as responsive as possible when discussing features, pull-request &amp; bugs.

Shuttle uses a few modern technologies &amp; libraries, including RXJava, Retrofit and Glide - and I think there's plenty to discover there for all kinds of developers.

However, I'm no expert. So, if you see some crazy piece of code that makes your eyes bleed, make a PR or let me know!


For Shuttle users:

Hopefully Shuttle will become a bit more active, and you'll start seeing some more features sooner.

I'm also using a public issue tracker now (https://github.com/timusus/Shuttle/issues), so it should become a little easier to track the progress of feature requests and bug fixes.


---

I'm really excited about this new chapter for Shuttle, but it's quite nerve-racking as well.. Shuttle development has been a dictatorship for the last 4 years, where I've had the final say on everything. I'm now stepping back a little bit to allow others to contribute, so that will take some adjustment.

The other scary thing is putting all this code out there for everyone to see. I imagine this is how Cersei felt being marched naked to the Red Keep. I can imagine some developers digging around in the code and ringing a bell, crying 'shame, shame'. There are a few shameful bits of code, but there's some gold in these hills as well.


Anyway, I'm probably gonna fall asleep pretty soon, but I'll be back in a few hours to answer questions, so AMA away.

Im working on a UGV (Unmanned Ground Vehicle) robot that is controlled wirelessly, the robot is supposed to have 2 cameras mounted on 3 motors, a motor for each axis, the user is supposed to see through these cameras using a VR headset, my problem is i dont really understand which sensor should I use on the android phone to track the head movements, I tried the orientation sensor but i cant figure out how to interpret the Yaw, Pitch, Roll values to simulate the head movement

for example : 

if im wearing the VR headset and look to the right what i thought would happen is that only one value would have major change in its value, but whats happening is that all YPR values are changing dramatically, 

Is there some kind of calculation i should do on the values or maybe use another sensor ?

1846,How would you add/sync large amounts of data to a database?,"For example let's say i wanted to add a list of all stocks in an stock exchange to a database (I'm currently using Firebase Database). The two initial problems i'm seeing is:

1. How would i add the large amounts of data to the database?

2. How do i keep the data up to date? B/c i would need to ""refresh""/sync the data so it displays the current prices of each stock. I do not need it to be real time, i'm fine with the opening and closing prices aka, up to date but not THAT up to date.

One solution i see is to write a bit of ""hidden"" code in my app that allows for an admin user/account, such as myself to press a button and read/write to the database from information off of the web. However, this solution would require me to open and press refresh at least twice a day to keep the information current for all users which does not seem correct.

The other solution is to skip using my own database and just access the information from a website when a user requests it in my app. However the problem with this solution is if the website changes in anyway, my app will crash, ie my app relies on someone else's website to work which also doesn't seem right.

So how would you and how DO other apps accomplish this? Hopefully my question is clear and thank you for reading!",1489588766.0,2017-03-15 14:39:26,1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/androiddev/comments/5w7s19/how_would_you_addsync_large_amounts_of_data_to_a/

                    httpcon.setRequestProperty(""Accept"", ""application/json"");
                    httpcon.setRequestMethod(""POST"");
                    httpcon.connect();

                    //obj

                    //Write
                    OutputStream os = httpcon.getOutputStream();
                    BufferedWriter writer = new BufferedWriter(new OutputStreamWriter(os, ""UTF-8""));
                    writer.write(data);
                    Log.d(TAG, ""Sent Post to Google :D"");
                    writer.close();
                    os.close();

                    //Read
                    BufferedReader br = new BufferedReader(new InputStreamReader(httpcon.getInputStream(),""UTF-8""));

                    String line = null;
                    StringBuilder sb = new StringBuilder();

                    while ((line = br.readLine()) != null) {
                        sb.append(line);
                    }

                    br.close();

                    e.printStackTrace();
                } catch (IOException e) {
                    e.printStackTrace();
                } catch (JSONException e) {
                    e.printStackTrace();
                }
            }
        }); t.start();
    }
}

But it is throwing me an error and telling me the URL of Google's API doesn't exist. 

Right now I am thinking the error may be in that I need to maybe manually add in authentication? I'm not sure how to go about this because there is very little documentation on the matter. 

If anyone knows where I am going wrong with my POST request it would be a great help. Thanks.

1914,Need Advice: How to pitch to boss to convert app to MVP?,"Some background: This is my first real job and I'm technically the only full-time Android Developer in my company of ~8 ppl. The first iteration of the app was developed by my boss and the previous android developer(he transitioned to become iOS developer) and have been using the old Android style that we are all taught in the beginning. Basically having all business logic inside the activity/fragments.

However, constantly seeing MVP being brought up has built up alot of pressure and uneasiness with codebase not being in MVP. The app works completely fine and in my boss's eyes it is not top priority for an architectural change. The reason he told me was because we as a startup don't have the leisurely time big companies have as we are racing against the clock. Having an architectural change will have a lot of refactoring work, will probably take 1+ months, and in the end users of the app won't see much change. I do agree with what he has said, but at the same time I feel uncomfortable.

Forgive me if I'm wrong, but the only big reason for MVP is the convenience of unit testing. We have no unit tests for android! Since our app is doing fine without unit tests, it's kind of hard to pitch and see the benefit of something that will require 1+ months. For testing right now we have a QA tester going through certain test cases for every build.

Should I continue working until the company grows big enough to actually be able to afford such a big codebase change? or is this an issue that needs to be addressed right away?",1489595034.0,2017-03-15 16:23:54,0.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/androiddev/comments/5wkh01/need_advice_how_to_pitch_to_boss_to_convert_app/

Currently, I have it so that the local puzzles are displayed in the list view upon loading the app and the user can press download which opens a new activity with the available puzzles to download. But this seems a bit clunky, it would be much simpler if they were displayed in the same list view.

I was asked to evaluate the best method of publishing an update for only certain countries, within the countries of the app. 

This means the some countries would download the new update from the app store while the other would download the previous version.

From reading google I get the feeling that this is not possible or at least not trivial,  but comments and SO answers tell me that it is, in fact, possible.

If it's possible does anyone know how would I go around to do this?

1983,User interface for Android messaging functionality,"I am looking for a library that can handle the UI side of a simple chat/messaging application.

I have tested ChatKit and Firebase Android Chat, and although they are quite customisable, they do not appear to have any UI handling for 'Message failed to send'. Also ChatKit (which seems to be the better of the two) doesn't even handle image sending.

Now Chateau seems to cover all of these bases, but all the examples are built using Parse, and no longer work. So I am struggling to follow exactly what is going on as I can't test out any implementation/follow what is happening.

The user-interface functionality that I am after is:
Messaging, Image sending (direct from camera and from gallery), emoji's and message error handling. I'll be the first to admit that I am not too great at creating effective UI's, which is why I was looking for a library that could handle it for me.

The messages are just push messages of which I have all the implementation for, it's just the UI that I would like to use a library for.

The thing is, I have very limited skills and I made it clear to her I started picking it up in my free time in the past couple of weeks (spent about 4-8 hours thus far). She said it would be a very basic application to make, but I really do not feel confident in this at all.

Would it be a realistic goal if I studied 2-4 hours a day to be able to make it starting next Friday and be due the following Monday?

Again, she said it would be a basic application and I should not have any trouble. On Glassdoor some reviews said it has been an RSS feed reader or a simple weather app.

&gt; this submission was an update to an existing app, the version
&gt; published prior to this update is still available on Google Play.
&gt; 
&gt; Please address the issue described below, then submit an update with

&gt; 
&gt; REASON FOR REJECTION:Violation of the Google Play content rating

&gt; 
&gt; These guidelines apply to all content in your app, including user

&gt; questionnaire for your app and resubmit your app for publishing.
&gt; 
&gt; All submission rejections are tracked. Repeated rejections due to
&gt; policy violations will result in app suspension, at which point this
&gt; app will count as a strike against the good standing of your developer

&gt; If you feel we have made this determination in error, you can submit
&gt; an appeal on the Google Play Help Center.

&gt; a policy compliant version of this application as a new package name.
&gt; 
&gt; This notification also serves as notice for other apps in your
&gt; catalog. You can avoid further app suspensions by immediately ensuring
&gt; that no other apps in your catalog are in violation of (but not
&gt; limited to) the above policy. Please also ensure your apps’ compliance
&gt; with the Developer Distribution Agreement and Content Policy.
&gt; 
&gt; All violations are tracked. Additional suspensions of any nature may
&gt; result in the termination of your developer account, and investigation
&gt; and possible termination of related Google accounts. If your account

2094,What's the best way to do multiple HTTP requests sequentially?,"Hello!

So I've gotta make many, many HTTP requests sending different files each time. What's the cleanest way of implementing this?

Unfortunately the HTTP requests have to be done in this way due to the server limitation so I can't change that before someone says to :p There's also an issue where I can't do too many requests at once 10+ because I risk killing the server (-.-)

Essentially I get the server ready for the file transfer by doing a few HTTP requests, and then once that is done I begin uploading files one by one in individual requests, then finally I call a completion request and the jobs a goodin'.

So my question is what the best way to handle this? I'm currently using an AsyncTask but I want to improve this, I'm struggling getting the sequential one after another requests to work, either I use too many threads or I accidentally lock the thread and nothing else finishes.

My idea is to improve my current AsyncTask by using the preExecute method to do the intial few calls to prep the server and then the postExecute to do the completion call. How can I implement the AsyncTask to go through an array of Files (File[]) doing one request at a time until they are complete, I already have a system for handling any failures so no worries there.

I'm currently using okHttp3 for this and it's working nicely however I'm not against swapping to a better library if needed.

My primary issue so far appears to be the fact that starting a HTTP request starts another thread with a callback rather than the code just waiting for the request to be returned, therefore launching another thread. If you need any more info ask away.

Thanks in advance for any help! I'm a bit surprised how complicated doing HTTP requests can be.",1492375902.0,2017-04-16 20:51:42,13.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/androiddev/comments/5xipgp/whats_the_best_way_to_do_multiple_http_requests/

I have a simple list app that whenever you hold one of the list item  the app goes to ""Selection mode"" for the list items but it also changes the toolbar for one with more icons (and funcs) on it.
The changes happens instantly and I would like to make it a bit smooth with animations, best with fade out for the previous toolbar and fade in for the other one.

Im using AppCompactActivity and have 2 menu XML which switch at runtime by clearing the menu and inflating the other menu using 
     getMenuInflater().inflate(R.menu.selection_mode,menu);

If you want to see what is my desired result for visual understanding, go to the Google Keep app, highlight your notes and see the toolbar awesome fade in/out.

Is there a library that may help me or am I even far away from solution?

How difficult, technically speaking, is it to code an app that:
1. incorporates a server that accepts incoming data
2. can expose the server to the internet from behind a router using UPnP (no router access)

I'm designing a fun little app in my head, mostly just for kicks, and listening to the outside world from behind various wifi points is important. ",1492379824.0,2017-04-16 21:57:04,0.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/androiddev/comments/5xqeg2/upnp_w_androidbased_server/
2126,Lost my release keystore (with my release certificate),"So basically I was trying to understand why I couldn't install the apk into my cellphone and while searching in the internet how to export my release certificate into the debug keystore, I switched parameters and overwrote my release keystore with the debug certificate :|. Then I found out that it was not being installed because while generating the apk from android studio, I just checked the ""Full APK Signature"" box.

My app is still in alpha, just a few friends have it, so I'm not way way too worried. Still I would like to use same package names and blablabla... which I found the worst way that it's not possible with a new certificate.

tl;dr;

I'm dumb af and lost the damn keystore with the release certificate.
But wait. The thing is that before losing the keystore file, I ran the following commands:

`keytool -exportcert -alias my-alias -keystore keystore`

`keytool -list -alias my-alias -keystore`

`keytool -list -v -keystore keystore`

So I have the output of all the above in my terminal. The question is: can I generate the certificate from this information? I believe that yes, but I do not understand much about certificates.

Edit: any tool that helps to recover lost file in mac os x would also help...

Edit3: did not get reply from google so far, but I have created a new app anyway...

2209,Adobe Air to Unity3d to Android Studio - Signing problem,"Hi there,

I created an app with Adobe Air and therefore I used a p12 key to sign and publish the app.

Later I ported the app to Unity3d and so I converted the p12 to a .keystore file.

keytool -importkeystore -srckeystore myairkey.p12 -destkeystore myunitykey.keystore -srcstoretype pkcs12

Now I ported the Unity3d project to Android Studio. As I tried to upload my app to the developer console it complains about different signing keys (fingerprints)
I'm using the same .keystore file as I do in Unity3d so I can't figure out what's the problem. Somewhere I read that Android Studio signs release builds with the sha256withrsa algorithm - is this the difference between signing an app with Unity3d or Android Studio? 

Any ideas on how to solve this?",1492388457.0,2017-04-17 00:20:57,0.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/androiddev/comments/5y7m0g/adobe_air_to_unity3d_to_android_studio_signing/

2245,What do you guys think about a reddit-gold-like subscription model with IAP?,"I have an app which kinda aims to be used by a ""niche"" target (specifically regular train commuters).

It offers some really specific functionalities for commuters which are not offered by the other mainstream train apps, and since I still don't have a lot of users, I think it doesn't really make much sense to implement ads that will only make it worse for the users with no real gain for me.

Now, what I thought I could do instead is a reddit-like kind of patronage: i.e. add a view at the bottom of the home screen which says something on the line: ""this month this many people helped pay for JustInTrain server time. \*button to IAP*""

Did any of you think about doing something like this already? Either way, do you think it could be of any use or better than other revenue methods?

XXXX name

where XXXX represents four numbers.
And it will search a forum board of mine that will return results from that forumboard. The forum board will likely be vBulletin or Xenforo. I'm willing to try others though.


So how hard is this application to develop? I'm learning the android ecosystem right now but I definitely don't feel comfortable with it. 

Also, this is off-topic but does anyone have any resources to recommend to learn android from? I hate this big nerd ranch guide to android that I have.

I now have the impression that a (vast?) majority of Android users are not willing to pay for an app upfront unless it's from a well established brand.

So, my next move was to quickly fork the app into two versions: free with ads, paid without.

After further research I'm wondering whether it will be worth the trouble to maintain two different versions, and if I shouldn't just solely release the free, ad-supported version and be done with it.

Its basically in ""classic android style"" with all my code in activities/fragments. I'm also using and liking android databinding so i was hoping to continue incorporating that as well. Looking to refactor it to one of the more testable patterns like mvp or mvvm but dont really know where to begin. Every tutorial kinda adds in other stuff like butterknife or Dagger that im not sure i want to include right now. I tried posting this in the weekly feedback/help thread last night with no responses, maybe i was too late in posting it as the thread is not up anymore. 

The app is here:

Github: https://github.com/johntzan/FutWeekendLeagueStats

Play Store: https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.weekendleague.stats.prod

The app is very specific to what its used for, which is entering a player's game stats from a video game(FIFA) on game consoles.

Any feedback on the app would be greatly appreciated, thanks!

I learned some c++ and am now a webdev guy with Javascript, angular, node, html, http, css, and knowledge of things like that. I've got basic experience with APIs. But I can't for the life of me figure out where to start with building my first app.

Yet I often see on the internet stories about 10 and 13 year olds building either their first apps or some of their newest apps and it makes me go ""How are these kids learning how to do this when my computer science curriculum doesn't even touch these kinds of things!?!!?"". Note, my webdev experience came from an internship, so I've really only learned c++ in college.

 Eventually I'll be creating a ""flavour of the month"" type app that connects back to some type of database as the information in the app will constantly be updated by myself with new info, pictures and rearranging current information. 

 I just need to know what path I should be going down for the database once I have all the basics covered, the rest I should be able to get my head around. 

 Is it normal to have a cloud service hosting a database for an android app? Or is there some kind of Android software that allows you to have an in built database that is easy to update once the app has gone live?

2409,Terrible experience with Udacity Android Certification process,"Hi,

I signed up and paid for Udacity's Android Certification exam last September and the whole process has been a complete cluster f#$!. 

First thing, the actual exam is very easy. If you developed any simple CRUD  app, you will most likely pass.  

I did exam and waited for my results. It took more than 2 months t o get back the results. Granted this is a new certification program so I am gave them some slack as they are probably playing catch up in grading. They say it would take less than 2 month at most for 'manual' grading. 

When it was finally graded, I couldn't check my score because the website is broken. Don't understand it. Contacted support and they haven't gotten back to me with the final grade. I didn't really care as I wanted to use my second attempt to get a perfect score. 

When I went to go to take the exam again, the second attempt immediately started after my first submission. Didn't realize it at the time. **So my second attempt was 2 months past due**. I am seething with rage at this point. How are these charlatans in business with google? 

Support was gracious enough to allow me to submit my exam to them through e-mail. Did that and had to go through the exit interview. I couldn't understand the interviewer. I think he was from Turkey... He had a thick accent. Answered some very basic questions and I pretty sure I passed. He told me I would have to wait another week to get the results of the interview..... He couldn't tell me if/what went wrong with the interview nor could he tell me. He just told me I'd have to wait. I am tapping out at this point. I just want my money back. I don't want the certification. It means nothing to me. 

Support got back to me and told me that the interview was inconclusive and I had to interview with someone at google proper. GREAT! ""I look forward to speaking to a native English speaker. When can we schedule the interview?"" *Looks at e-mail* ""ohh you didn't send me a calendar invite"" *facepalm*. 

I sent several e-mails and I still haven't heard back from them. 

This can't be real right? Someone must be messing with me. 

Has any else had this issue with them? 

If anyone from udacity or google reading this, what the hell is going on?

2412,"First app. The very good, the good and the rest","Hello Androiddev  
  
Many people here seem to wonder how to get started, here is how I did it, hoping it may help some.  
I always forget birthdays, needed some kind of reminder. Searching the Play Store, I could not find any app I like, most are good for their functionalities, they do the job, but look unappealing, ugly or old design, not really pleasant to use.  
Since long I wanted to learn about Android development. So I decided to dive in and make mine.  
My knowledge of Java was very basic, I did some long ago, so I had to seriously refresh this too.
My background was mainly Python, Clojure, Golang, JavaScript.  
  
## The very good  
   
**Community, sample apps.** I found a lot of code and educational apps on Github, that helped a lot. /r/androiddev was a huge source to learn from too. The Android community is just GREAT.  
  
## The good  
  
**Learning.** I love learning, Android APIs are well documented, third party libs are awesome, I used Dagger, RxJava, MVP and others. I learned in books, online docs, Github code, Stack Overflow helped too although it's a bit chaos and confusion.  
I still feel very messy and far from being good. Need to write a lot more code, the prob being that I don't know any experienced Android dev. The biggest piece is RxJava, it is hard to get but worth it to avoid entering Android's million ways of threading. Android is big, it requires to dedicate a lot of time and coding to become decent at it.   
  
**The tools.** I love Android Studio, it makes refactoring so easy, code suggestions are very useful to me. I enjoy it.  
  
## The rest  
  
**Tests.** I did almost none, I had already a lot to learn on other parts, so I delayed, that's a mistake I will not do again. I found it not so easy to test my app afterwards, test early.  
   
**Rejected!.** I use photos to initialize my app. All are in public domain or under Creative Commons, for which I respect the terms, name the photographer somewhere. My app was rejected twice for copyright infringement. Wtf? An appeal for reinstatement solved the prob in a timely manner, three days.  
The appeal system works well, the review process is rigid and kind of guilty unless proven innocent.  

**Java 8.** Some of Java 8 features are still missing, that would be nice to have.

I got sick of setting up dagger and modules in new apps so I decided to [create my own template app](https://github.com/V1rus999/MVPDaggerTemplate) which I can download and start with the basics already set up.

As you will see I kept it as empty as possible and kept the names as vague as possible. The idea is to rename a few things in a new project and start coding. The project contains an app, networking and a java only domain layer. It uses dagger and butterknife for DI. It contains retrofit for networking. It has a thread manager as well.

No DB has been added as I feel that will probably change with each project.

2471,Implementing an account-type shared between apps,"I'm currently making a login library that will be implemented in multiple apps (using the accountmanager).

It works flawlessly as a module implemented across the apps. As long as the apps share the same keystore (naturally).

ISSUE: Company has a big app (lots of users, would prefer not needing a new keystore), that is signed with a different key (originally made externally). And this app will also need the shared login-capabilties.
But when I use the initial implementation, users aren't visible 'across' keystores and attempting to login with a different authenticator than the account-owning app (first app installed with that login), causes a crash as the authentication-activity adds account explicitly.

MY ATTEMPTS:
I tried adding an intentfilter to the authentication activity, but this leads to the app offering two apps that can handle that intent, an app from each keystore.

I've tried following guides such as [this](http://blog.udinic.com/2013/04/24/write-your-own-android-authenticator/), but I still can't even get it to show an [access request](http://blog.udinic.com/assets/media/images/2013-04-24-write-your-own-android-authenticator/access_request.png).

I've read of solutions such as [this](http://stackoverflow.com/a/27016178/4021839), but forcing user to install additional app just to use login seems overly obnoxious.

Additionally some describe [using permissions to gate access to the login](http://stackoverflow.com/a/40537217/4021839). However as I understand, this requires that the first app installed with the login must have the permission defined, but since Android 5 you cannot have the same permission defined in multiple apps with different keystores (only if they share keystores). So this also seems unlikely.

Anyone have any experience with this? I've only been working with the accountmanager for 2-3 weeks, so still relatively green. But I'm a but at a stump atm. as to how to do this best.

**TLDR** I need to share an accountmanager across keystores. Any advice?

2492,How I brought my Android MVP stack to iOS Swift,"Hey everyone,


I’m Android developer that has recently got back into iOS development, and really needed to get up to speed in a short amount of time with the current iOS frameworks, Swift, and popular 3rd party libraries.


On Android I primarily develop with MVP, utilising RxJava, Dagger as my core architecture libraries, so I attempted to apply this refined knowledge over a period of time to the iOS side of things, and took a basic iOS MVC app and converted it to MVP and re-create it in Android, with both sharing identical extensible business logic layers.


I couldn’t find any iOS resources which combined all of these concepts into a single project, let alone a project comparing the Android and iOS frameworks with these core architecture libraries included, to enable developers who build against either platform to transition across to the other in a manner where framework syntax is the primary barrier.


[**Here is the Android project**](https://github.com/teeeeeegz/DuckDuckDefine-Android)

[**Here is the iOS project**](https://github.com/teeeeeegz/DuckDuckDefine-iOS)


For those who are trying to understand the fuss of Rx and Dependency Injection on the Android side of things, you can loosely [**use this guide**](https://github.com/teeeeeegz/ribot-app-android-workflow) as an abstraction of how the main layers connect together.

People are looking for a plug and play solution and bot framework would be the front runner in that situation I believe.

I'm a final year computer science student at university and have elected to make an app for my final year project, which is due in just over a month. 

Basically i know nothing about making apps and have been trying to learn for the past 2 weeks, with no real progress made. My dissertation supervisor has no experience in android development so he can't help and I'm really getting scared about failing my degree, to the point where i cant sleep due to my fear. 

My app is basically a movie database app and I've drawn up some UI designs on Moqups, but translating that into code and providing the functionality of the app is something I really need help with because i am a very unconfident coder. Not knowing where to start is really preventing me from making progress and i feel as each day goes by I'm getting closer to failure.

In such short time I cannot see bigger advantages over Windows systems - currently I am struggling to get used to know shortcut commands, etc. Also, I do not own any other Apple product (phone, TV, tablet), never did.

So I am kind of torn between iOS or Windows OS platform and cannot decide which to look for.

Today, just for fun I reduced all of my images request resolutions by half. So instead of requesting a 1080 x 800 I am requesting 540 x 400. The images look pretty good. Don't really notice a difference.

Brings me to the question... what do the guys at big companies do? Should I keep messing with it till I notice a decrease in quality? I literally halved the amount of data being requested over the network so I'm pretty happy with it, but curious if there are any sane defaults that people use. Also... I'm pulling every image from the network with 80 percent compression... does anyone recommend going lower than that also?

Some questions:

* If a phone has 4 cores, and one thread is the UI thread and the other is the camera2 thread, can I run only 3 other processes in parallel ?


* If I spawn a thread upon every frame received and expect them to finish in a reasonable amount of time should I be worried about ""running out of threads"" ? Is there some sort of a queue if this happens?

2540,Steps to Freelance,"Hi All,

(Hopefully this is both related and not a nuisance of a topic)


I'm interested in eventually becoming able to become a freelance android developer part time while I finish up my degree in CS.  I have a few questions regarding how I could accomplish that.

First of all, what would be the necessary steps you see in someone becoming an android developer?  So far I'm working through the Big Nerd Ranch book (It may be a little noob friendly, but I found it helpful as an intro).  Moving from that, I'll complete the more advanced Udacity courses (while simultaneously developing my own apps for a portfolio).  Aside from those two steps, can you guys recommend any necessary steps that assisted you with your android development path?

In addition, for anyone who has moved from independent studying to freelance, at what point did you feel comfortable being able to actually sell your services? (Bonus points if you can point to a play store link of an app that acted almost as your tipping point).

Finally, for freelancers in general (and as the subject pertains to android developers), what additional knowledge is necessary or resources have you used?  By this, I mean any skills used outside of those sold (e.x. generating contracts, necessary steps for building a network, uh, I guess ""soft skills""?)

Ending Note: There are other topics in the past that have addressed issues like these.  However, usually the most commented topics of this lot is from 2-3 years ago.  I feel as though this time frame is large enough that it warrants discussion, considering the speed at which mobile development changes at.",1492418677.0,2017-04-17 08:44:37,15.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/androiddev/comments/5zuvrl/steps_to_freelance/

2551,Competition in 5 years,"Hi Android Devs,

I was wondering if anyone has put any thought into the hiring landscape in 5 years time? I really like developing for android but i really don't want to get heavily invested in a field which is about to get flooded by high school kids competition as it leads to let salaries.

Specifically i was thinking, kids the days are taught coding in school (which is AWESOME I'm super jealous). They'll start building apps because, hey it's fun to do! Not ask if then but perhaps a significant number will go on to become mobile Devs. My concern is that the mobile development field will start to look like the web development. 100 people claim they can build an app, 50 actually can, 5 use best practices, 2 document their code and 1 does it in a reasonable time for a reasonable price. However, (s)he still has to compete with all the other ones and honestly, i hate that. It's specifically why i left marketing and am studying full-time CS.


As an alternative I'm thinking of going into ML because it's sexy but I'd also more math intensive and therefore has higher entry barrier. Ideally I'd combine that with distributed systems to build the world's first crowd powered AI (send calculations, receive results, similar to that protein-folding programme)  MWAHAHA ... Imagine the headlines...^^ anyway, I'm getting sidetracked.

1. Player name
2. `TextView` that displays the score using methods `displayForPlayer1` and `displayForPlayer2`
3. Three buttons:
  1. `Victory` button which increasing the score for victorious player by 1 point
  2. `Loss` button which leaves score of game unchanged, according to the rules of the game of chess
  3. `Draw` button which button which increasing the score for each player by 0.5 point
4. `Reset` button which resets the score for both players back to 0

I'm primarily interested in using it for the following use cases:

1. Smooth drawer close animation while switching between sibling views/fragments/controllers (navigation drawer)
2. Speed up inflation speed of multiple viewgroups/fragments/controllers that are displayed simultaneously.

Is #2 possible? Can I inflate 4 different views using `AsyncLayoutInflator` in 4 different threads at once? Or are all these layouts required to be inflated on the same background thread.",1492427345.0,2017-04-17 11:09:05,2.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/androiddev/comments/60blka/asynclayoutinflator/

2658,FCM Device Token Handling,"I hope this is the right place to ask this question.

Currently at my work place we are writing our own implementation that handles the device groups and registration_ids from Android/iOS devices for Push Notifications with FCM.

It all seems fairly easy so far and I have it working by storing the device group in my database against the users as well their registration_ids.

Now when a User reinstalls his app or token is refreshed by google, how can I handle that on my server?

For example, if he reinstalls the app, the device registration_id will be refreshed correct? Then my backend will never know that the old one is expired because it is sending notifications via the device group token. Should I just send notifications via registration_ids only? So then I know which ones fail?

2676,How to share data between two presenters in MVP architecture?,"**Here's an example scenario:**

I have an activity (view) and a presenter for that view. The presenter fetches a list of users from a network API and holds it in memory using a List&lt;User&gt; object. The activity contains different types of fragments to display the content about the users based on User.type. The two fragments (UserType1Fragment and UserType2Fragment) have their own respective presenters too. 

The activity's presenter decides what type (I or II) of fragment is shown next based. The fragments' presenters decide how the user object is displayed and handle a button click event called killUser(). This should update the List&lt;User&gt; object in the activity's presenter.

**This is where the problem lies.** How do the fragment presents have a reference to the data in activity presenter? The presenters shouldn't directly communicate with each other. Maybe I should abstract out the List&lt;User&gt; into a repository/interactor?

What would you guys say is the most successful way to earn from android. I have made a very very basic service app and want to expand now. I know it used to be easier before and that the market is very saturated now, but is there still hope for a hobbyist developer?
Is it more profitable to make games or productivity apps? 
Is it better to pursue an idea you yourself find interesting(with the hopes that others will like it and be interested) or to do something that has a specific purpose and caters more to the general public.

What about web development(html, css), is there more money there for a freelancer?

What are your thoughts!?

2706,Best Way to Tell if Users are Together,"Hello everyone, I'm a software engineer by profession with most of my time spent in the .NET world. I did a few Android apps back in my early days in college, so I'm a bit rusty on modern Android development...

The Question:

I was wondering what the best way to figure out whether a group of users are within close proximity of each other. The solution would preferably be cross platform to support users in iOS environments and of course within the Android environment (I'm a big Android fan myself), but getting it working on android devices is step one...

Context:

I'm looking to create an app that periodically (every 30min - 1hr) checks to see if a group users are together. If they are it prompts them for input which will get posted to a server and it wont check again until the next day. Otherwise it will keep checking at the next period. I don't need coordinates of the users, more of just a Yes/No are they together. I'm thinking I'll handle the scheduling of the checks on a web server, sending a GCM message to the groups phones to figure out if they are together. So the logic resides on the server while the apps are just clients for checking if the users are together and collecting input if so.


My Thoughts:

I did the usual Googling before writing this post and these are the solutions I've come up with:

* Google Nearby API (the messages option) - Seems like my best option (?) Its cross-platform and does pretty much what I'm looking for. Seems a bit heavy for what I need though and I'm not a big fan of (although I understand the need for) the persistent popup telling the user that Nearby is active.

* Location Pinging - Second option I came up with was Pinging the users location. Send the GCM message, grab the location, post it back. I also looked into the fused location provider and just subscribing to location updates. Another good option, but would require the users to keep their GPS on if I want accurate location... Unless the Coarse location is good enough to tell if users are in proximity to each other.

* Wifi Networks - I've seen people do something similar to this in tasker, check for a list of SSIDs on each of the devices. If they are the same or similar, then they're together, otherwise they are not. Downside of this being that if anyone is out in the middle of nowhere there is no way to tell if they are actually together.

* Cell Towers - Another tasker-esque idea, similar to the Wifi Networks. This one seemed like a good option to me at first, scan for cell towers and see if they are the same between the groups phone. The benifits seemed to be that it didnt require GPS, Bluetooth, or Wifi to be enabled. I wrote a quick app to test this theory out by just logging the results from getAllCellInfo, which worked great on my Galaxy S7 but I only got back null on my cheap $50 prepaid LG phone.

Is there any standard practices for doing something like this? Am I looking at it incorrectly? Is there a wealth of knowledge that I missed with my google searches?

ImmutableListUtils - a tiny set of functions which result in a NEW LIST after every operation. Not the worst results compared to lazy evaluation.

2723,[DEV] Earnings and Statistic from my Android Game - Bomb Rain,"Hello all, a month ago i had release my first Android Game, now i would like to share downloads/earn and other statistic:

Game got downloaded  ~200x, here are Country/Android Statistic:


[Charts and Statistic](http://imgur.com/a/1w3IU) 

Here how look download in Amazon Store vs Google Play:

Game got downloaded 31x in Amazon App Store (right now 2-3x per day), on Google Play it got downloaded 178x (4-7x per day), record of game was 30x downloads in one day.

Here are earnings:

Unity Ads: 17,25$

Kongregate: 1,43$ (1555 Plays).

Chartboost: 0,27$


I don’t like games, which spam player with banners, full screen ad, and IAP, the thing i hate most are auto playing video. That’s why Chartboost got so low earn, becuase in whole camping i show 0x  Chartboost ads. My favorite Ads are Video Ads played by users, i think they are non-invastion form of ads.

Game had generate 18.95$, but to withdraw this cash i would need some ammount of cash first (like a 100$ for Unity Ads). So game had earn 0$.

Would i make today again „Bomb Rain” Yes, even if this game would get again very low ammount of downloads, earn nothing. When i was developing „Bomb Rain” i had learn alot things about coding simmple games, Android Platform, and i have possibility to fix alot of problems, i still learn programing, i don’t count for any earnings right now, i got time. I had alot of fun developing game.

From a interesting things, in top 10 devices, wchich had install my game, 50% of them are Samsung,  + alot of Huawei devices, and we got a one (in top 10)  Xiaomi Redmi Note 3.

Right now i foncus on marketing „Bomb Rain” (i had learn alot about marketing), I plan also to make a next game, it will be Idle Clicker (70% sure), but right now  i focus on developing updates to Bomb Rain + marketing.

If You got any questions, write them, i will try to answer them all.

Like will option 1 using SQLite mean the data size of the app increases? Whereas with option 2 it does not?

Any advice and tutorials on both methods would be firmly appreciated.

I would like to go with option 1 use a SQLiteDbHelper Class to perform Create, Update and Login  functions.

Thanks for any help in advance.

2744,Looking for ideas on UI patterns for how to capture security questions during user onboarding.,"I've got a design from our UX team that was adapted from a website design whereby new users select and then answer two security questions. It is currently designed as four screens - select question go to next activity, answer question go to next activity, select second question go to next activity, answer question, complete - and I'm thinking this might work with the paradigm of hiding sections of a large single webpage form but not really on mobile.

Any ideas on how to approach redesigning this? Maybe a viewpager with question selection, answer, question selection, answer? Or something else entirely?

I'm hoping there is some consensus on how to do this in the Android community. I've looked at how my currently installed apps  do this and unfortunately they don't.

2746,"Looking to make my first app, advice welcome","Hi guys so I'm currently a IT apprentice who has been offered the chance to do a software design apprenticeship which gives me a bachelors degree and 2 of the modules of the course were: 

**Object oriented programing with java**

**Mobile app design**


So I'm looking to get started a bit early and had an idea of doing a calendar/scheduling app. 

The reason I chose this was because at work we were migrating our email servers and outlook wouldn't work for 2 of our new workers until we completed the migration. Their regular email app for Samsung Tab A also wasn't connecting to the exchange server so I had to go into the app store and find an alterative until migration was over.

Upon looking at the calendar apps in the store I found all the good ones were either price walled or only gave 1 week trial before you had to pay. Seeing this has lead me to believe that this would be a good app to make especially since I will have to start making business apps for my company.

I started coding 6 months ago and most of the coding I've done so far was either JavaScript or VBA so I'm currently learning Java's syntax but have downloaded Java and Android Studio to start practicing.

So for the specifics of my app idea I was thinking to make it animal themed. So the user could design an animal like a cat, dog, snake etc. and have them deliver the updates or alerts like ""You have X appointment in 2 hours"".

Maybe there could be an animation of them running or sliding from the corner of the screen to say the message on the home/locked screen?

2752,j2objc vs Intel Multi OS Engine?,"I'm working on a new product and the android app is coming along nicely. So far I'm a one man show and I'm trying to get an MVP done by end of summer. I have ~3 years of Android experience and am pretty comfortable in Java and Android. I've dabbled here and there with iOS, I believe shortly after Swift 2 came out. Usually I'm pretty against software promising to make your app on every platform ever (React Native, etc.) but I may be interested in some of the lower level ones.

The app's UI is quite simple. The difficult stuff comes from some pretty heavy realtime audio calculations that I would really, really love to not have to rewrite in Swift. If it comes down to it and I absolutely have I will to but I've been looking into j2objc and Intel's MOE which seem pretty interesting and could help. If I could write the really intense logic once, that would save me so much time. Does anybody have experience with either of these or have insights into how the development process is, performance trends, etc?

I've broken out my code, all of the business logic has been separated from platform dependent logic (UI, using device peripherals, etc.). From my understanding, MOE packages the ART runtime with the app and binds the bytecode to iOS system calls, and j2objc generates objc which you can then plop into your project, although I have read that 3rd party libraries are often difficult to integrate with this.

I did the Android Basics courses on Udacity, and I have started making a workout app. I previously asked about it here: https://www.reddit.com/r/androiddev/comments/5w1891/does_my_app_idea_make_sense_and_where_do_i_start/. Now I've made a non-dynamic version of the layouts here: https://github.com/superfluffys/fivefactor/tree/nondynamictry and a dynamic version here: https://github.com/superfluffys/fivefactor/tree/dynamictry. 

My question is: How should I make the screens change accordingly? I think I am supposed to use the dynamic version, but I can't figure out how to make a counter in the Java file that will increment when the Done button is pressed. 

All I can come up with is manually setting the counter to a number, and then when the app is run, it does create the correct layout, but when I press Done, it re-starts and goes to the same layout. I think I am just looking for it to start at 1 and then press Done to go through all the cards. Later I want to save the counter number permanently so you open the app the first time on the first card, and each time after, you go to the subsequent card.

2794,Why do people hate React Native and like Java so much?,"I'm burned out from developing Android apps. Here's an example of how difficult it is. If I want to create just a simple list and display it on the screen, I have to use all of these classes like Activity, Fragment, FragmentManager, RecyclerView, ViewHolder, and Adapter. And then if I want to just make an array of items, I have to create a class for each item where each item's class has getters and setters, then I have to make a wrapper class that has getters and setters. If I ever make changes to the data, I have to change the data procedurally, which is very error prone and hard to understand. It ends up being 500 lines of code just to display a list of data.

I don't even like JavaScript or React, but when I learned React Native in just a few minutes, I literally didn't need to read any books because it was so simple. It's just about taking data and mapping it to a view, that's all it is. All I had to do to display a list of items was initialize a list of data, which is 5 lines of code, then write the view by mapping over the data, which is 10 lines of code and it's way easier to read and understand. When I update the state, it's very declarative and easy to understand and less error prone. I turned my 500 line native Android Java program into a 25 line React Native program. I am confused why people don't use React Native or they don't like JavaScript and they prefer Java. I really want to be able to like Java, but it's very difficult when I have to write 500 lines of code just to display a simple list.

I feel like the only reason to choose native Android with Java is if there's something you can't do with React Native or if there's some kind of performance problem.

Let me know if there's a way to make Android development with Java more enjoyable. Please correct me if I'm wrong about anything. I want to learn if I'm wrong about anything and I want to get to the point where I enjoy developing Android apps using Java.",1492443250.0,2017-04-17 15:34:10,8.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/androiddev/comments/616dof/why_do_people_hate_react_native_and_like_java_so/

2808,What technologies to use for an android app,"I know its a very basic questions for people who have been doing android for a while but for someone who is thinking this to be there first app, an input would be appreciated. 

**Requirements**

1. User should be able to sign up/sig in
2. Use could create multiple groups
3. Other uses can joing those groups
4. One user should be able to communicate with other user (just like messages, but not that real time.)

**How would i have designed if it wasn't android**

1. Have a db instance 
2. Rest API's 
3. Each client will poll that db in regular intervals to see if they have any messages

**Problem**

 1. I want some solution where i have to spend minimum amount on yearly basis. So does Google provide any basic solution for this? Since it will be my first app, I want to keep my operational cost to zero or minimum.
 2. I read longtime ago that google launched something called GCM (Google Cloud Messaging). Can this be used here?
 3. Is there any better way to deliver messages to a device? Polling may drain the battery. I am looking for some PUSH design but is there anything which Google already supports or provide?

2817,"What is my ad spot worth? (30,000 clicks per month)","Fellow Android devs. I have been fortunate enough to get a lot of traffic to one of my Android apps. I'm getting over 2k downloads per day and have over 100k active monthly users.

2 months ago, I put an 'ad' in this app to another app of mine. Really, it was just a CardView with a vertical LinearLayout inside. It actually looks a bit better than a regular ad, because it doesn't have to load over the network and is natively styled.

So in Firebase Analytics, in the last 30 days alone, I've gotten 34,000 clicks of this ad by 22,000 unique users.

The traffic has resulted in more downloads and store impressions. From the ad, the Play Store has reported the following:

27,000 store impressions
1,500 downloads

The traffic is spread out internationally. Here is a Firebase Analytics screenshot around the 'ad_clicked' event of the last 30 days - http://i.imgur.com/Tn9LUIy.png

What is this worth? $500 per month? I think I might be able to just sell the ad space myself instead of bother with a CPC program. Find someone to go on a month-to-month basis.

1,000 of the ad clicks were from the US. Are those 25 cents each?

How much are international ad clicks worth? 5 cents? 2 cents?

2820,Trying to make a self-ordering kiosk app for Class. looking for advice/tips.,"My school has 2 self-ordering kiosk systems on campus that are used to order wraps, salads, etc. The lines to use them can be pretty packed in between classes and sometimes the machines don't work/run out of papers for the receipts.

So for my class project, I had the idea to make an android app that would basically be more convenient than the kiosks on campus, since food can be ordered on the go, doesn't require paper receipts, and ultimately reduce the long lines.

The normal kiosk allows you to choose the ingredients for the food, and then prints out a receipt. Once the order is complete, the kiosk would send this information to a server, and the order number and order progress is displayed on a TV screen.

I was thinking of simply mirroring what the kiosk does and make an android app similar to that. I guess i would used a second phone to act as the server/tv display that tracks the order numbers/order progress.
I've been searching on google for some sort of articles or examples to get a better idea of how to approach this, but i'm not finding much because I'm not sure what exactly to search for.

Anyways, I was wondering if anyone here understands what I'm trying to do, and if they had any advice/tips or maybe articles that could point me in the right direction. I'm also not sure how I would go about sending this information from one phone to the other phone to update the order number and progress. I'm still fairly new to app development.

2823,Which CPU is better for Android Development - Ryzen or i7 7700k?,"I'm planning to build a new rig but can't decide on the CPU. Currently I have MBP late 2013 with i7 4850HQ and when I build my project all my CPUs are going to 100%. Medium to big projects are taking 5-10 minutes to build, instant run helps but sometimes when I change 1 line of code it makes a clean long build anyway, this is infuriating on big projects. 
So I wonder does Ryzen's 8-core/16-thread will help the gradle? 7700K has only 4 cores but per-core perfomance is better so if I can't utilize all cores than i7 is better choice.

I would never, ever have installed tracking like this without getting permission from users. To find out that I have two separate tracking systems in the app is astonishing. They completely hide from you that this is going to happen. They give very simple instructions for getting started and getting the functionality you want and make no mention of the fact that they are installing tracking functionality which is automatically enabled beside it.

2902,"Thinking of porting an app of mine to Android Wear watches, should I split my codebase?","Hi there!

So I'm not a very experienced android dev since it's not really my job, more of a hobby. Recently I've began wondering about android wear, and realized that one of my app could work great on such a format. But I know nothing about the android wear SDK and I don't even own an android watch. I don't even know if I'll release the app or not, but I want to try nonetheless.

But for now my biggest question is about project management. I wonder if I should keep all the code in one single project, making different builds/flavors, or if I should simply split the codebase into two projects, one for tablet/smartphone and the other for smartwatches. 

I know the downsides of the second solution, I would have to keep two codebase updated with changes, but I don't really know about the first solution. I never really used the build system for much more than ""generate signed APK"". So I'd like to know more about that.

* Is it easy to generate two different apk for the same project? Any good practice/guide you could share?
* My app is really light and I want to keep it that way. So if I do keep it all in one project, will the code dedicated to the smartwatch end up in my smartphone/tablet apk and vice-versa?

2905,Playstore : Copyright infringement for use of free material,"I recently worked on a port of a free (as in beer) personal accounting application called [HomeBank](http://homebank.free.fr)
Since the application is under GPL license I felt the right to reuse the name and logo.

I directly asked the author anyway, and he allowed me to reuse the name/logo for the android version.


I submitted the app, and quickly received an email from google accusing me of copyright infringement.
They linked me the [following page](https://play.google.com/about/ip-deception-spam/) and said that my app's logo was the same (no kidding).

I filled an appeal with a [link to the discussion with the author](https://answers.launchpad.net/homebank/+question/537898) about reusing his logo and a link to [the GPL license in the source code of the original app](https://bazaar.launchpad.net/~mdoyen/homebank/5.1.x/view/head:/COPYING).

Google answered with a automated message saying that I shouldn't't reuse a logo that isn't mine.

**TL;DR:** *I used free material and was rejected by Google because of it.*
I'm surprised there is no obvious way to deal with it, so I'm asking for advice and help here :
- Have you guys encountered similar problems ?
- How did you deal with the issue ?
- Any advice, really``

I can't link the page because it's blocked by Google, but here is the [Github](https://github.com/monsieurh/homebank_android), along with a [screenshot](https://imgur.com/a/Bl1uO) so you can see the logo I talk about in the upper left corner.

2924,I want to develop an Android app and a Windows app. Which platform should I use?,"I want to make an Android app and a Windows desktop app with the almost same functionality. It's my personal project with no other developers.
I have developed a few Native Android apps in Java, Kotlin, or Scala.
Also, I have made some personal C# apps using WPF.
I haven't used Xamarin.

Option 1.
Make a native Android app with JRE languages.
Use a platform like JavaFX or ScalaFX to build a Windows program, which has the same functions.

However, I don't like to use JavaFX, Swing, or such kind of things. Also, Java Windows programs really suck for both very light programs(Java Windows programs cannot be light enough) and very heavy programs (especially due to memory issues).

Option 2.
Make a Xamarin Android app and Windows program with C#.
The problem is, that I can't expect what troubles will come out later when I program an Android app in Xamarin.
I have read several reviews of Xamarin, and they always said ""At first, they seem really good. Later, there suddenly comes out some limitation that Xamarin cannot handle.""

Option 3.
Do implement all functions twice, in JRE languages (like Java, Kotlin) and in .NET Framework languages (like C#, F#).
I don't like this option...

So the core question is probably this.  
Is Android Xamarin recommendable now?

New options for each test:

* Clear data before each test
* Clear notification bar
* Parameterize
* Filter and run by tags

All this by using simple custom annotations. like this:

    @Test
    @ClearData
    @Tags(tags = {""sanity"", ""medium""})
    @Parameterized.Repeat(count = 3)
    public void myTest() throws Exception {
        String param = params[index];
        // ...
    }

And for each failed test we:

* Collect Logcat + stacktrace
* Record video (mp4)
* Dump DB (sqlite)
* Dump default shared preferences (xml)
* Collect dumpsys files like: battery, netstats and other.

In general, it's easy to add more options since the tests are executed one by one from bash script rather then from gradle task.

2968,Fastest way to develop app?,"Sounds like a classic questions. But, I need a framework (engine, whatsoever) to develop Android app. Preferably cross platform with iOS and web as well.

I know, I know, perhaps the answer will be to use whatever I am comfortable with. I rarely do app development but game development. I know how to make game with C++ using SDL. However, things like Unity or GameMaker will, for sure, done the job faster, even for someone who is godlike with SDL.

__So I need these Unity or GameMaker but for app development.__

As for what I need for my upcoming mobile application.

* I need a QR reader.
* I need computer vision. Perhaps access to OpenCV?.
* I need to extract pitch and volume from incoming audio from phone's microphone. Something like Aubio or PyAudio, both are Python libs for audio processing.
* Connection to RethinkDB.

As for my background, I usually develop Arduino and RaspberryPI. I code my programs in either, HaXe, NodeJS, or Python. But overall I am an agnostic programmer. I occasionally do simple web development with as little framework as possible to just testing stuffs out.

2977,JCIFS is LGPL and many closed-sourced and paid apps seem to use it. Is this legal?,"As far as I know, if you want to read files from a Windows network share, JCIFS is the only libary (is there any other?). A lot of famous closed-source (and paid) applications seem to use it. For example, ES File Explorer, Solid Explorer, Asus File Manager, File Commander, etc...

But the problem is that JCIFS is under LGPL, which basically tells ""either use a dynamically linked library or disclose your entire application's source code"". It seems that the ""APK"" file does not have separate libraries inside it, but a single binary. That is, app source code of the APK must be disclosed.

I tried to ask about this on StackOveflow, but [someone had already asked about it](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/4916512/using-lgpl-library-in-paid-android-app). There were a few answers, but the most strict answer seems to be creating two separate ""APK""s, one that contains the LGPL library, and one for the rest. But, as far as I know, most of the famous aforementioned apps do not come in seperate APK's.

My app needs to read files from Windows share, but creating two APK's would make it difficult. Since a lot of other famous apps seem to just violate LGPL and include JCIFS inside of it, no one really cares about this? I can just do that too?",1494549724.0,2017-05-12 00:42:04,2.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/androiddev/comments/62tive/jcifs_is_lgpl_and_many_closedsourced_and_paid/

2982,Recyclerview with many imageview blocks animation,"Hi,


I have an recyclerview with up to 100 imageviews in it. Upon user action (swipe) the images are updated all of them. So I have to notify that the whole dataset changed. In the meantime I display a fading and translation animation of another textview. Due to the huge amount of the image views inside the recyclerview the animation of the textview is laggy. Did I mention that I have two recyclerviews? 

This sounds all crappy but believe my I have reasons for this. This is a game where in the middle is a grid. The grid contains images to which the user has to react in a certain way. The grid is then animated and another grid appears. To make this possible I have to display two recyclerviews. Also the images within the grid are animated. Thus I actually need a recyclerview and cannot fake it with tiled backgrounds. When the user action was correct the grid continues to grow up to 100 images (10x10).

Now I have to optimize it no matter what. If anyone can help it would be really appreciated! Thanks.",1494550564.0,2017-05-12 00:56:04,0.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/androiddev/comments/62v68t/recyclerview_with_many_imageview_blocks_animation/

3008,Advice on Picking React Native or Java for Android Application Development,"Hi,

I'm interested in developing an Android App for myself and I am currently thinking about whether it is best to use React Native or Java for the application.

I am currently leaning toward using React Native, the main reason for this is because I currently use React JS for building Web Applications in my day job. So I feel there I would have crossover skills and I could apply the knowledge I already have to get an app off the ground faster and more effectively than if I used Java.

I have a little experience using Java for Android Development from my college course, but would probably have to refresh and extend my knowledge of the language which would probably involve a bit of time, money and effort

So, I was hoping to gain a bit of insight from any experienced Android Developers into the following questions:

1. Can you do everything in React Native that you can do in Java? Or is there features that are only available using the native programming language (Java)?

2. How does React Native interface with the overall Android OS Architecture i.e. does it put me at a disadvantage as opposed to using Java?

3. Are there any compelling reasons to pick Java over React Native?

4. What is your general experience of using React Native for developing Android Applications?

Thanks in advance for any feedback.

""Android Studio\plugins\android\lib\templates\activities\common\root\res\layout""

3035,Android O dev preview breaks my app,"...and there's nothing I can do about it. Yet.

I'm the dev of [Status](https://github.com/TheAndroidMaster/Status), which uses a system overlay to give users the ability to customize their status bar with (almost) no limitations. Granted, this isn't the most efficient method, but it gets the job done pretty nicely and it didn't get half a million downloads for nothing.

The problem? In Android O, TYPE_SYSTEM_OVERLAY is replaced with TYPE_APPLICATION_OVERLAY. This means that you can no longer draw over the system bars (instead of appearing on top of the status bar, Status instead shows below it). Well, that should be fine, right? Just keep the target SDK at 25 and you'll be good. Small problem: this change is independent of the target SDK. So no matter what version you're targeting, you'll be forced to use TYPE_APPLICATION_OVERLAY instead. This doesn't just break Status, though. There are loads of apps that use TYPE_SYSTEM_OVERLAY, many of which will either become completely useless or need a large amount of development to compensate. Some of my favorites are Telecine (Jake Wharton), Power Line (UrbanDroid), Clean Status Bar (can't remember), Material Status Bar (friendly competitor) (Trey Dev), and HeadsUp (AChep).

[The issue](https://issuetracker.google.com/issues/36574245) has recently been 'passed to the development team', so hopefully that means they'll do something about it. Nobody that I know has found any ways to get around this other than waiting for the result of [the issue](https://issuetracker.google.com/issues/36574245), and I definitely can't think of any. If anyone has any ideas of things I could try, I'd love to hear them (aka I don't want my child to become completely worthless in a matter of months please help 😂).",1494556081.0,2017-05-12 02:28:01,18.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/androiddev/comments/6363f3/android_o_dev_preview_breaks_my_app/

3047,ElectricSpock - yet another attempt to bridge Robolectric and Spock Framework,"I love [Robolectric](https://github.com/robolectric/robolectric) and I love [Spock framework](https://github.com/spockframework/spock) for unit testing. However they are not so friendly to each other because they handle test cases so differently. 

There is a project called [RoboSpock] (https://github.com/robospock/RoboSpock), which attempt to bridge two libraries. With RoboSpock, Robolectric code can be executed within Spock framework test cases. 

However, RoboSpock has not been updated long ago and it does not work with Robolectric 3.1 and after. On the other hand, Robolectric progress in full speed with support to later version Android API.

So I decided to revamp the whole things. Based on the code from RoboSpock, I create a library known as [ElectricSpock](https://github.com/hkhc/electricspock). It work essentially the same as RoboSpock, but it keep up with the latest Robolectric (3.3.2 now)

Those using Robolectric as primary framework for unit testing Android app are encouraged to have a try. Comments are welcome.

I want only the row item from the RecyclerView that I have clicked on to animate itself into the TextView. At the moment the whole RecyclerView fades away and the TextView fades in.

Any tips on how to achieve this? I'm not even sure how to Google search a gif to use as an example!

BTW I am working with API 18. 

Edit: OK [here's a good idea of what I'm after](https://assets.materialup.com/uploads/c4e8f1c9-6d4a-4005-8bc7-463e169672d4/preview.gif). Notice how the selected item in the RecyclerView looks like it is singled out before transitioning to the new scene. It has the effect  of that single item is the one doing the transition rather than the whole RecyclerView.

Edit 2: Looks like what I want on API 18 isn't possible. :(.

3095,Looking for a new laptop that will run Android Studio well ($1200-2000 CAD),"Hey everyone, 

I'm currently looking to buy a new laptop and am not sure what to prioritize in terms of system specifications. I have posted in /r/suggestalaptop but I figured you guys would know a bit more on Studio specifically.


I have been looking at Dell XPS 15 and the Lenovo Yoga 720 as possible options for me. I have mostly been looking at the quadcore kaby lake 15"" models with discrete gpus (GTX 1050), but I'm starting to wonder if the quadcore/dGPU is really going to give noticeable performance gains.


Essentially it's coming down to the I7-7500U and the I7-7700HQ and the Intel HD 620 graphics vs GTX 1050. Is the **SSD/RAM** going to affect performance more than **CPU/GPU**? If I go with the I7-7500U/HD 620 route than I will likely be getting 8gb RAM w/ it.


I'm a beginner with android studio, but experienced in OOP and would like to get into making some Android games. I'm also an engineering student and so the ability to run CAD and other intensive software would be a plus.


I also have a desktop PC with i5 2500k @ 4.5 Ghz, 8Gb RAM, GTX 970 4gb, and SSD. This configuration runs Studio very well, but the RAM usage is around 90% w/ Google Chrome and some tabs open.


Right now I can get a deal on the **Lenovo Yoga 720 15""** with 16 GB RAM, I7 7700HQ, GTX 1050 and 512 GB NVME SSD w/ 4k for **$1319 US**. I'm leaning towards this option right now.


Thanks for the help.

Prof is having us work on our final and said that we can get top points for creating an App. My mind went straight to my hobbies and i found an app on the store which seems easy enough (maybe?) to copy or use as refrence. The app mainly tells you if its suitable to fly a drone depending where you are and current conditions. EX: youre at home and its raining so no flying. Or you live next to an airport so thats a big nono. I also wanted it showing a google maps showing if youre free to fly or not. if you look up B4UFLY on the app store youll see a couple examples. How hard would it be to go from knowing some java to producing a duplicate? id really love to create and app i could use for my hobby and final.

3102,UI Testing application without DI and no presentation pattern,"Hey guys,
I've been assigned to write UI tests for application. The content that is displayed is almost entirely taken from the server and code is not organised in any decoupling manner like MVP does. My tests so far cover most of the UI but they are entirely coupled to the database. What do You think, is it worth to develop and maintain those tests further or give up testing if the code base is in such condition? From what I understand if I'd want to mock the server I'd have to create somekind of static database with always the same content but locally, and when development database have over a 50 tables with lots of records I don't think that'd be a good idea. Any ideas how to manage testing in not so testable code base?

---EDIT
To elaborate more on the coupled tests to database. The problem I had was too many different types of content not to mention that app have more than 5 flavours with different content. On the one hand in UI tests we have to know what we want to test, but on the other hand the tests shouldn't be coupled to code in any way. I decided to couple the test code with business logic and database, in the tests first I'm querying database for the content, applying business logic to know what's where and then I'm testing the interface based on my results. This is actually my first approach to testing in general. What do You think about this?

If I use events, then I may get a number of events for setting the value as the user is experimenting with the app. This means I am probably interested in the last event and would like to disregard the previous ones.

In Google Analytics I could probably use a dimension per setting. Then the value of the dimension would be either x, y or z. The number of dimensions is limited but my app is just a hobby project so it shouldn't be a problem.

Currently I'm using Firebase Analytics. I don't like it due to it's limited support for custom events and params (they require BigQuery - a paid option). I used to use Google Analytics but the UI seems too complex for me.

Maybe I'm doing wrong when trying to compile Android 7.X with a kernel source of Android 4.4.4 (in case this is logic).

3258,Wi-Fi and Wi-Fi Direct questions,"Hi! I've been developing a chat app that would support both Wi-Fi (legacy) and Wi-Fi Direct (P2P) clients. I have questions regarding my current experiences. I am currently developing it using three smartphones, one Samsung (4.2) and two local brand phones (a 4.2 and a 4.4.2).

The application works smoothly on both 4.2 devices however, the 4.4.2 device is quite special. My 4.4.2 smartphone has a *wlan0* and *p2p0* network interfaces (used in Wi-Fi and Wi-Fi Direct respectively) however it uses the same MAC Address. I checked it via [OS Monitor](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.eolwral.osmonitor&amp;hl=en). Now, this phone is able to detect peers but cannot be detected. Also it cannot discover services via Wi-Fi P2P NDS.

So is it safe to say that this phone does not support Wi-Fi P2P? Or what should I do to fully support it?

Now, for connecting Wi-Fi and Wi-Fi Direct clients and according to the [Android Training](https://developer.android.com/training/connect-devices-wirelessly/wifi-direct.html#connecting) said that I could connect legacy clients to P2P clients by requesting the group info. How can I do this if the legacy client does not have a p2p manager to start with? Or is it the same case with my 4.4.2 phone which can use the p2p manager?

Checking SO I see I'm far from the only one. In my case the culprit seem to be that I'm using play-services 10.2.1 which are linked to 24.0.0. An answer on SO suggests downgrading buildtools and all dependencies to the 24.* range. Not exactly something I'd be happy to do.

3266,MVP - how is intermediate/state-tracking data handled?,"I'm a part-time Android dev whose built a few apps in the past, but although they've gotten fairly complex, I've stuck to the basics in terms of architecture - simple Activities, Fragments, Services, and not much else.

Now looking to upgrade and build something using a proper MVP pattern. I've been reading a fair number of tutorials and guides, and am starting to get a handle on things, but had one question: where does 'intermediate' data get handled? Is it in the presenter? Model? View?

To elaborate a little on what I mean by 'intermediate data':

Let's say I'm building a simple news app that lets users select what topics they're interested in, and then alerts them about top stories in those topics whenever relevant. So to the user, I might present a grid of topics, and they can tap each one they find relevant.

Now, once they've tapped all the topics and click 'Submit' (or whatever), the model layer is in charge of sending this list back up to my server and doing whatever else it needs to do. But what happens while the user is tapping on various topics and I need to be keeping track of them?

If it was a simple Activity, I'd probably have some kind of `List&lt;String&gt;`, and just add on each topic to it as it was clicked. Then, when the 'Submit' button is clicked, this list is packaged and sent to the back-end. In an MVP setup, is it the View that maintains this running list? Should the Model be saving it down after every new topic is selected? Probably missing something obvious here...

3283,Epoxy 2.0 Released,"Release notes are [here](https://github.com/airbnb/epoxy/releases/tag/2.0.0)

The main change is the introduction of an [EpoxyController](https://github.com/airbnb/epoxy/wiki/Epoxy-Controller), which replaces the previous adapter approach. This controller forces a one way data flow, which is a bit of a mix between MVVM, and Model-View-Intent.

I developed it after watching our Android team use the original Epoxy system over the past year, and noticing all the common pitfalls and questions. The new system makes it almost impossible to make some of the old mistakes, and now it is much less confusing to use. 

The new system has diffing built in, so you never have to think about item change notifications. Models are also now immutable, so each list of models represents a ""snapshot"" of the RecyclerView state at the time they were built. 

We now use Epoxy in about 160 components in our app, with 30 Android engineers on the team. We've found it to work very well for our team.

Other notable features include:

* Support for Kotlin
* Support for programmatic views
* Support for click listeners
* Support for grouping models

I also revamped the documentation with a brand new [wiki](https://github.com/airbnb/epoxy/wiki).

There is also an [updated sample app](https://github.com/airbnb/epoxy/wiki#sample-app) to demonstrate the new features.

I still have quite a few features I'd like to work on next. These can be tracked on the [issues](https://github.com/airbnb/epoxy/issues) page, but highlights include:

* Support for databinding
* Sticky headers
* Integration with Item Touch Helpers

I also welcome contributions from the community!

If you have any questions I'm happy to answer them here, or feel free to open an issue on Github.",1494581692.0,2017-05-12 09:34:52,66.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/androiddev/comments/64lbt1/epoxy_20_released/

3312,[Marketing] What're some effective ways to utilize 2000$ in Android app marketing?,"

I'm making an Android Application. This is a chat room type of application. This is going to be my first app . I don't have much experience on App store marketing. So as I mentioned I have only 2000$ for promotion purpose. But the problem is as it's a social media type of application. Without much user this app is little bit of boring. So I want to promote this app using that money and somehow want to get 100k downloads on first month. 

 I know about ASO and other organic stuffs. As I am also managing a blog I have good knowledge on those keywords SEO tricks. 

But I want suggestion on how should I utilize those 2000$ to achieve my target of 100k downloads on first month .

Thank you !!! 😁

3319,The Code Templates in Android Studio are a great way to generate boilerplate code,"Do you folks use the Code Templates in Android Studio (ie. `File: New\Activity`, or `File: New\Fragment(List)`, etc)?

I really find them useful, and like how quickly I can create a variety of different Android elements quickly.

The template for creating a RecyclerView Fragment is a great example.  The wizard is simple, and the many different files (multiple layout files, adapter, Fragment, etc) are all generated automatically.  The resulting code is clearly formatted, and follows established patterns.  _Before using the template, I would probably have copied a different RecyclerView from another project, and manually modify it to suit my needs_.  

I will be super dangerous at future hack-a-thons, now that I am a bit more familiar with how these work.  I can stub out an app pretty quickly.

I recently created a [video series for Caster.IO](https://caster.io/courses/bootstrap-an-app-with-android-studio-code-templates/?utm_src=mswreddit), which shows how to create a new Project, with a NavigationDrawer, ViewPager (each tab containing a RecyclerView Fragment), a Google Map, and an Intent Service.   I create a fairly robust app, in only 20 minutes. _BTW, most of those bootstrap videos are free, not all the videos on Caster are_.

_Just wanted to share my enthusiasm for the Code Templates. They have come a long way.  They are a super useful way to bootstrap an Android project quickly_",1494585374.0,2017-05-12 10:36:14,89.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/androiddev/comments/64sp8f/the_code_templates_in_android_studio_are_a_great/

3353,I need some Camera advice! Roll-your-own solution just isn't cutting it anymore.,"Greetings fellow Droiddevs. I was just hoping to get a bit of extra eyes on what I imagine is something we've all dealt with - dem Camera APIs.

Here's what I need:

* A stable and performant view-only camera that can be wrapped (covered up with) custom controls
* Something that takes into account most of the current crop of flagship devices and their camera quirks
* API level 16 compatible

As a solo dev working on a fairly massive project, I just don't have the time or energy to full commit to all of the device-specific nuances that crop up with these darn APIs. Things I've asked in the past include: 

`Which devices rotations are accurate? Which aren't?` `Which require a unique accounting of Surface/Texture change callbacks?` `Which sometimes have a correct preview size but an incorrect accounting of it?` `What scales and quality params work, and which don't?` `Is Samsung involved - if so, have you tried hitting it with a hammer yet?` `(_for iOS devs_) Where is my AVMediaMagicFixAllTheMediaInputzController!?`

That being the case, I've run through pretty much everything I can find on who's doing what with what library and where. It seems there are a few more active choices:

* [Google's offerings, sorta kinda](https://github.com/google/cameraview) `// forked by below, but seems less robust`

* [Gogopop's CameraKit-Android](https://github.com/gogopop/CameraKit-Android) `// seems the closest to my needs`

* [The Venerable Mark Murphy's CWAC-2](https://github.com/commonsguy/cwac-cam2) `// will need lots of customization to make view-only`

* [MaterialCamera, seems fairly developed](https://github.com/afollestad/material-camera) `// haven't heard much about it in my circles`

And now the question(s): **What are you guys using these days? Are you still rollin'-your-own? Do you always farm out to the device and deal with cross-app file access?**

As always, thank you to the community (et. al) for the assistance over the years in figuring out some of these Android pain points!

I want to use these x and y values to graph the path of the robot. How can I do this in Android Studio?

I can also set the speed and heading from the Java code. These values are passed into a function that can tell me the current location (x and y coordinates relative to the initial position of x=0 y=0) of my robot at any point in time.

So, all I need to do is use these x and y coordinates to trace the path. The frequency with which I'll be receiving the status info is 1s.

3387,Has anyone managed to get Gradle Composite Builds with Android Studio?,"[Gradle 3.1 introduced composite builds](https://docs.gradle.org/3.1/release-notes.html#composite-builds).

Basically a composite build lets you tell Gradle that a binary artifact should be substituted by a local external project. So that this:

```
compile 'org.sample:number-utils:1.0'
```

Gets linked to:

```
compile project(':number-utils')
```

Where `number-utils` is now an external project.

Gradle supports this natively but the real advantage is with having Android Studio link straight to the external project and to edit the source of the artifact.

There's a [blog post from IntelliJ about this](https://blog.jetbrains.com/idea/2016/10/intellij-idea-2016-3-eap-gradle-composite-builds-and-android-studio-2-2/) but it seems that Android Studio doesn't support it.

I'm new to Android (less than a year developing) and I updated to AS 2.4 when it first launched. I think it's amazing, there are many new features I love to use, and a bunch I have yet to try. However, being new to Android &amp; AS has some downfalls (obviously), sometimes I can't tell if it's my code causing an issue, or if it's a bug in a new release/preview. I think it would be great to validate any bugs others are encountering, that way some of us do not spend hours debugging only to realize it was something with AS.

I know there are some active members from the Android team that browse this subreddit. Maybe this could help them.
  
For instance, right now my debug app gets really laggy after several restarts/reruns in AS. The only thing that will fix it is ""invalidating cache &amp; restarting"". I'm sure this is somehow a problem on my end, but it would be great if it wasn't :).

I'm developing a text-based zombie game where a child becomes a zombie. So far it's basically "" You see Child A crouched over Child B's dead body, feeding on him. She has become a zombie. She must have been bitten or somehow infected the previous day and lasted this long.""

Reddit app view load time on switch: 1254ms. 90 ms atributed to conductor.  
Super light stack view load time on switch: 108ms. 9 ms ms atributed to Super light stack.  

&amp;nbsp;

I think there is something funky happening in that reddit app though and the 4s boot time (1200 ms of conductor) might not be conductors fault.  
Why is this the case? My answer is that conductor uses reflection to get the default constructor for each view class every time you do a  pushController-&gt;RouterTransaction (switch views)

3439,"Anyone else finding ""App Releases"" section of Developer Console that replaces old APK release process to be a lot more involved/annoying for uploading new builds?","It *looks* nicer and I suppose is better for a quick overview, but the actual process of uploading a build and releasing feels really onerous now. It used to be that you could go to the right tab (Production, Alpha, Beta), click upload new APK, drag your APK over, and click Publish now. It was really nice when I'm doing rapid-fire uploads to Alpha and don't want to jump through a bunch of hoops for release. Now you have to click ""Manage alpha"", ""Create Release"", ""Upload APK"", drag &amp; drop, click save draft, click save after scrolling to bottom of page, click review, get barked at for not putting release notes in because OF COURSE it doesn't just automatically use the same notes you put in your last version, THEN click start rollout to alpha. By my count, that's 4 steps now turned into 8 (not counting the annoying ""put in release notes!"" part). They've literally doubled the amount of effort I have to put into publishing a new release.

Am I missing something? Are there benefits to this new UI/UX that I'm overlooking? Because right now I just feel really cross every time I have to deal with this, which is basically every day as I'm nearing a full release and fixing bugs to be tested in alpha internally.

3440,Making Native debugging work in Android Studio in non-standard cases,"**Edit**: This following information is only of interest to those using CrystaX instead of the original Google NDK.

Debugging C++ code has been supported in Android Studio for quite some time already, but I never managed to get it working, until now. From what I have seen on StackOverflow, some people also have troubles getting the debugger to work, so I'd like to tell what has worked for me (for a quick run-down see the end of post).

&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; 

By default, the debugger was ""working"", but it wasn't stopping on breakpoints or showing variables values during a crash.

A quick inspection of loaded symbol files via 'image list' command shown that it was because LLDB used the versions of libraries from which all the debugging information was stripped. This was not surprising, because Android Studio itself does not build C++ code (instead doing a call to ndk-build or CMake, unless we're talking about experimental NDK support, which is not installed by default), and therefore does not know where the full versions of libraries reside. It only knows the folder you have specified in 'jniLibs' list in Gradle build file, which contains already-stripped versions.

&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; 

The problem seemingly should be resolved by specifying the path to unstripped versions of libraries in Run-&gt;Edit Configurations-&gt;Debugger-&gt;Symbol Directories. However, it never did work for me, and for other users too. LLDB keeps picking up the unstripped library for some reason I was unable to discern.

&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;

So, the only way I found was to make debug version of my app use unstripped libraries. Sure, it leads to a very large APK, but I can work with this!

First, I needed to turn off stripping during the NDK build phase. This is achieved by placing the directive

    cmd-strip :=

into your Android.mk file (CMake-based builds can control stripping in the usual way).

However, this is not enough, as Android Gradle plugin performs additional stripping when copying your files into APK. I needed to turn that off, too.

Android Gradle plugin actually has a command to specify which libraries you want to skip during the stripping task. It was undocumented until 2.3, but now the documentation [has](https://google.github.io/android-gradle-dsl/current/com.android.build.gradle.internal.dsl.PackagingOptions.html#com.android.build.gradle.internal.dsl.PackagingOptions:doNotStrip) a very short explanation for it. I tried it, and it wasn't working. The problem is that you can't just specify the name of the library there like ""libmyapp.so"". But ""\*/armeabi-v7a/libmyapp.so"" did not work for me, too. What worked was ""\*\*/\*/libmyapp.so"".

&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;

This way, you get LLDB to see an unstripped version of your library, and the debugging finally works -  unless you're using GCC instead of Clang to build your app for some reason (like I do - it's legacy).

If you do, you will need to modify your Android.mk further, by specifying -gdrawf-2 flag to the compiler instead of plain -g. This tells GCC to generated an older, more compatible debugging information, which LLDB can actually use (if you specify -g after doing the rest of things this post tells you about, you'll get an LLDB crash during attachment).

&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;

**TL;DR:**

&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;

1) Modify your Android.mk file (preferably for debug build only):

    cmd-strip :=
    LOCAL_CPPFLAGS += -gdwarf-2 #Only needed if you use GCC, not Clang

2) Modify your build.gradle:

    buildTypes {
        debug {
			packagingOptions{
			    doNotStrip ""**/*/*.so""
		    }
        }

If someone here from the Android Tools team is reading this, please have it taken care of. Either ask the user if he wants to use ConstraintLayout, or just don't add it to the dependencies, but offer a quick fix in the XML layout if the dependency is not yet present. You're the best!

the problem is whenever I make builds the system takes too much time and becomes unusable for 5-50 minutes.

I mostly use Android Studio + Chrome + Inkscape + Rhythmbox + Sublime + SQLite Browser concurrently the ram is not a problem but at build times CPU uses hits 100 for all 4 CPUs even if I close all other apps nothing changes except ram usage.

I tried reinstalling ubuntu but same issues.

3463,What to do with an app I no longer have time to maintain and work on?,"I have an app that I developed and that I've been running for about 2 years now. I have a decent user base that generates revenue, but not enough to live off of and go in full time. I no longer have time to work on the project or maintain it, so I am wondering what to do with the app. 

I have thought of three scenarios : 

1. Selling the app
2. Letting the app run till it dies out
3. Open sourcing the code so someone can fork it

I was wondering if there were any other options available?  

In the case of selling the app, are there any online marketplaces to sell apps and such? 

The app has a lot of potential to continue growing and there are still a lot of users who would like to see it grow, I just don't have the time anymore. ",1494599211.0,2017-05-12 14:26:51,6.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/androiddev/comments/65k9hs/what_to_do_with_an_app_i_no_longer_have_time_to/

3473,App Lock Screens: Bad Practice?,"I don't see how these offer any better security than the device's lock screen. Also, they force a bad UX. Overall, I feel they should be avoided. If the user is careless, there's a high chance any app-specific lock screen is going to be *just as insecure* as their own lock screen (ie, the user only opts for a very basic pattern lock screen and then goes on to type in ""1234"" for the app-specific PIN lock screen"").

Let's go over some use cases starting at the least security-knowledgeable user and work our way up to the highest:

* User that is just flat out careless: Android offers the ability to know what the status is of the user's lock screen (ie, whether nothing is set up, whether a pattern is used, whether is password is used, etc.). Forcing a lock screen for this type of user is just trying to prevent stupid. Just like passwords, you can't fix stupid nor is it the app's responsibility to try to fix stupid. Because we know the status of the lock screen, we can simply offer a suggestion (or even enforce) to set up a strong lock screen based on the level of security the app deems necessary (force a certain level of lock screen for a high-security app, make a recommendation for a medium/low-level security app, etc.). When was the last time you were forced to have two-factor authentication and a 16 character random password? The answer to that question is **never**. This removes the responsibility from the app but also provides the best experience as the user is not forced to enter an absolutely useless PIN whenever he/she needs to get to the app. (Side note, when was the last time you were asked to verify yourself to view your emails in Gmail on your device? Also **never**.)
* User that is worried about security, but needs guidance: Same as above. We can make the user aware of various situations by knowing the type of lock screen he/she uses and adding suggestions when first signing up. (Something like: ""You're using a pattern lock screen. Make sure you've set up one that's secure."")
* User that knows about security, but may or may not actually understand what he/she is doing: The user may not understand that something like a fingerprint or a pattern isn't the best for security. Simply give them some recommendations like the previous user.
* User that knows about security and understands exactly what he/she is doing: They already have a strong password/PIN/pattern set up. There's zero extra benefit of adding an additional lock screen for a specific app. Honestly, if you have a phone with a highly secure password and leave it on the couch, unlocked, in a friend's apartment who happens to want to ruin your life well we're back to the stupid argument. That's not the app's problem.

Overall, this seems like a useless security feature for the apps that employ it for both UX reasons and security reasons. Thoughts?

3530,FastHub for GitHub got suspended for violating impersonation,"So, Today I woke up receiving this from the playstore review team stating that my open source App has been suspended without given any reason after it has been in the play store for almost three months, before judging me, please notice that I think I've not violated any policy, the app name FastHub for GitHub, the word for GitHub is being used by other apps, the word GitHub itself is being used in plenty of apps with just the word AppName GitHub and so on, The logo was designed by a friend is a bit similar to GitHub logo but yet far away from it and again, there are apps up there that has the exact GitHub logo just on top of a circle or square icon.

P.S: I have submitted an appeal stating that I need more information because I believe that the automated system is just sucks!.


The message I received was as below:  

After review, FastHub for GitHub, com.fastaccess.github, has been suspended and removed from Google Play as a policy strike because it violates the impersonation policy.

Next Steps

Read through the Impersonation article for more details and examples of policy violations.
Make sure your app is compliant with the Impersonation and Intellectual Property policy and all other policies listed in the Developer Program Policies. Remember additional enforcement could occur if there are further policy issues with your apps.
Sign in to your Developer Console and submit the policy compliant app using a new package name and a new app name.



**Edit**: So, I got a reply and it was due to the icon as per their reply:

For example, your app icon infringes on the copyright of https://github.com/. Please see attached document for your reference.

We recommend creating a unique app icon that does not closely resemble any copyrighted images.

Next Steps: Within the next seven days, you'll need to log in to your Developer Console (https://play.google.com/apps/publish/) and submit an app update that complies with our policies.

Again, your app will not be live on Google Play until you submit a compliant update.

Why wouldn't they ban the apps that has the logo exactly like GitHub?

**Edit2**:  FastHub for GitHub is back in the play store with new temporary icon.

3533,"Location tracking feature is draining the battery on some devices, how do you handle it more efficiently?","I am working on the app that tracks user location, at least 8 hours every work day. We have users that are doing some activities outside on the field and, to get shit done, they have to use a car to go from place to place. Based on their mileage users get paid for the fuel by their company. That is the reason why we track them and why it’s very important for us to know exactly where they were.

We had the app that was doing the job, but we started to struggle with battery consumption. Our app is draining the battery faster than other apps and users started to complain about it.

I cannot leave it as it is, we need to find a better way to track the user’s location with less battery consumption. The first step is to review our process which is the problem.

We have two services:

**BreadcrumbService** — this service is getting the user location every 30 sec if the user moves more than 40 meters from last reading.

**FusedProviderService** — this service is getting the user location every 5 minutes if the user moves more than 200 meters.

Depending on some permissions we will fire one of them, but in some combination, both of them will be running. Both of them are using fused provider for location. Also, we are using PRIORITY_HIGH_ACCURACY as a parameter.

I wrote a blog post on medium with detail explanation what we did and what we plan to do, check it out here: https://itworkslocal.ly/its-not-easy-to-track-user-location-on-android-c76a64829ed0

How are other devs managing this situation?  Most of the time, I don't even know what changed in these files so I just commit it with something like ""generic update"" message.

3541,Best way to manage data for a local music player,"Hi,

I was wondering, how do local (i.e. offline/fetching from the device's storage) mobile music players generally handle their data during the application's lifecycle?

These are some ways that have came across my mind, but I'm really not sure at all, so I was wondering if someone here would have a better insight on this...!


**Option 1:** Fetching all at once and storing appropriately.

* Load everything at once, on startup (all the metadata, such as artist names, tracks, albums, durations...) 
* Store it in data structures and separate it by album/artist/...?
* If the user wants to see all tracks of a specific album, the information that's rendered comes directly from the previously-created data structure, and so on?



**Option 2:** Lazy fetching and storing.

* The data is only fetched (and then stored) as the user needs it. *I.e.* the first time a user wants to see all of a specific artist's songs, that data is loaded and stored. The next time that action is triggered the information is already there, so it's just a simple lookup.


Option **1** seems to be the most reasonable *imho*, but option **2** doesn't look all that bad either, depending on the use case. I mean, to me they both seem to have their *pros* and *cons*.

Sorry if this question sounds a bit silly; I'm really not an experienced android developer, but I'm legitimately curious.

3547,Is Android Development really this hard or am I just not getting it?,"I have tried multiple times now to learn Android Development but failed miserably every time. I have some LED bulbs by MiPow, but their app is shit and I wanted to develop my own app since I can control the bulbs rather easily via Bluetooth. But I am also interested in Android Development in general because I really like Android and it can open new opportunities in my career.

I am currently doing web development, so I already got some experience with PHP, Javascript, Python and everything related, but I also learned Java in school. I have no problems whatsoever with everything web related nor OOP, but as soon as I start an Android Development tutorial, I feel lost.

I got the feeling that you have to know like 5000 classes by heart just to create and fill a very basic ListView, make a web request or connect a Bluetooth device. I'm feeling like even after 20 hours of watching tutorials and programming, I'm still not able to build a basic activity without looking everything up. And like every second Android Tutorial is horribly outdated.

I just tried to write a basic activity with two buttons to start and stop a Bluetooth LE device scan. I followed a tutorial I found online, noticed that BluetoothAdapter.leStartScan() is deprecated, tried using the *official* Android Developer Documentation by Google for the BluetoothAdapter class, and even **that** tutorial does use the leStartScan() method although it's already deprecated. When looking at the documentation for the method in question it says there that it's deprecated and that I should use another class with another method, but no word on how to implement them into my already existing code.

Is Android Development really that hard? Is the learning curve really this incredibly steep? Are paid courses better for learning Android Development than free tutorials from somewhere on the internet? Am I just overthinking? 

I feel like I made faster progress back when I learned web development.

Although I'm usually a really fast and good learner, I just can't grasp the concept and that makes me feel really dumb.",1494609676.0,2017-05-12 17:21:16,72.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/androiddev/comments/665fbt/is_android_development_really_this_hard_or_am_i/

I plan on making other apps for other companies as well.  Does anyone have any experience doing this and what would be the best way to proceed?  I know one option is to get every company to sign some legal document giving me the OK to use their IP.  Would it be a better option to have companies each have their own Google Play accounts, and if so, wouldn't Google need to verify those accounts as well?

Using a low-tech solution like storing the installation date in the SharedPreferences works, but can be very easily circumvented even by non-technical users via uninstalling and reinstalling the app.


That's why I've developed a server-side solution that's very flexible (using offline grace periods, for example) and customizable - you can implement ""try once per device"" or ""try once per Google account"" trials, set custom trial periods, and even add multiple trials to a single app (one for each IAP, for example). I've decided to publish this as a library and open it up to everyone - you can check out the Android sample [here](https://github.com/trialy/trialy-android-sample).

3607,[AskRedditDev] Business Idea - Android App Localization Service,"Hi #androiddev I'm looking to get feedback from android developers that have at least 1 published app out on the play store.


I think there's a huge potential for helping indie app developers  translate their apps into all languages. Localization of apps would mean instantaneously higher install numbers.


I'm thinking of starting a new business wherein the system for managing translations is handled for you. There would also be a simple desktop app that watches for changes in your main strings.xml and can automatically bundle those changes and send them to the web translation management system.


Once the management system is executed well, it would then be trivial to add in professional translators as a service.


I realize that there are several other competitors including www.transifex.com and www.oneskyapp.com but I think there's an opportunity to create both a better experience and also a service that targets indie app developers. The service would require a Google Play account to be linked so that the service could be 100% free for indie app developers, but once they start making revenue, then they have to pay a monthly subscription fee.",1494616495.0,2017-05-12 19:14:55,0.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/androiddev/comments/66j8xe/askredditdev_business_idea_android_app/

3645,Machine Learning on an Android Device.,"I have recently pushed a new application to GitHub documenting my work on android devices using machine learning. I currently have implemented a MLP (multilayer perceptron) trained by the Wisconsin Breast Cancer data set hosted by UCI. To support the short battery life and power of a mobile device the learning methods are done on my server. The phone is an interface to send a request to the server, which will get fed forward though the trained algorithm. I hope to expand on this idea and continue my research. You can find my work here, https://github.com/Jbiloki/MLServe

I am open to any criticism and ideas. I hope to further implement new machine learning methods, even on the currently used database. I believe that I can be more accurate with a model such as SVM to help further separate the classes.

No matter which type of business you're into - Planster covers all of it. Need an alarm clock for every weekday morning? Secretery, who'll manage your meetings? Or simple one-time notification about your friends arrival? Few finger's moves and you're done.

App has NO ADS and NO IAP.

3680,(Open-Source) TerraLegion - AI with Behavior Trees,"**[Watch the video here!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S97D8hyZ6v4)** I went ahead and started implementation of AI for the entities within [TerraLegion](https://github.com/jmrapp1/TerraLegion). I decided to use behavior trees because it allows for simple creation of very complex behaviors that entities will follow. The abstraction of the defined behavior trees from the behavior implementations allows for easy modification and creation of trees using pre-defined or newly-defined behaviors and trees. The library I am using for the implementation is called Java Behavior Trees (JBT) and can be found on the [public Github page](https://github.com/gaia-ucm/jbt), although it's also within [TerraLegion's Github project](https://github.com/jmrapp1/TerraLegion). **[Watch the video here!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S97D8hyZ6v4)**

3701,What are some android only features you guys have added to your apps?,"Was told this might be a good topic to post.

For example compared to iOS we can autofill email addresses during sign up if we have the contacts permission. So users don't have to enter their email address all the time when signing in or registering. (Although this is changing in Android O which is very annoying).

Things like that. Features that you won't find on iOS but are actually useful and possible on Android.

I'm sure we've all worked on a project where Android is told to simply copy the iOS designs or features. Would be nice to hear some Android only things.

Another one I can think of is the password view toggle that's now part of the support library for TextInputLayout. Nice little addition that only requires one line of XML.

**Edit:** Some apps that require SMS authentication can automatically read the code they send you if you give them the SMS permission. It's a nice thing for the onboarding flow, but unfortunately not ideal to ask for the permission, because by the time they are thinking about accepting it, the SMS has arrived and they'll just input it.

Recently, I wanted to provide a link to the latest build of the app I am working on to others, based on whatever progress had been made. The app is currently using https://travis-ci.org/ for continuous integration, so I figured it would be nice to leverage that to deploy each build to Dropbox to provide the build. 

Travis does not provide this functionality out of the box, so I created a small Ruby gem to do so:

3709,"Dependency Injection. Why not just make every java method static and pass in ""dependencies""?","This is more of a hypothetical question, but I keep reading about DI (without a framework like dagger) and really, it’s great to pass things through parameters. Awesome. Makes sense to me 100%. But then I keep going back to, this question… Why shouldn’t I make every method in my classes static and the method takes in every variable it needs as a parameter and it just performs work on it.

Seems like instance variables are essentially just a shortcut/lazy way to not have to pass in instance variables therefore making DI harder. Anyone care to discuss?

I'm a junior Android developer with over 6months professional experience, worked on a project with over 200k users. Now I changed company (bigger city, better salary)...but here comes the problem

In my previous company we were writing good code (Dagger 2, MVP, Retrofit 2, RxJava, etc.) and now, in this company I'm the only Android developer and I got a pretty old and complex project... a lot of legacy code which is hard to refactor since a lot of stuff is custom made, some of you probably had similar experience...

So right now, I really don't see myself able to dive deep and change things on my own.. It will probably need much time, but I don't know if it is good for me, am I losing time working on a project like that... just an example, BaseActivity has 950 lines of code! Terrible

Good thing is, my boss isn't expecting miracles from me, but if I knew I was going to work that kind of code, I would think twice before accepting it.

3753,New to Android development and I have a couple of questions about working with it.,"Hey /r/AndroidDev!  I was inspired to create an app after seeing the Race for the Galaxy Beta app.  I'm looking into developing a (similar) card game app on Android and have a few questions.  My use-case will not need to be real time, and I eventually want to create a way for players to share games (both replays and head-head).  My background is hardware but I've had experience with embedded programming (Arduino) and modding KSP as well as experience with Java/XML (though nothing outside of a classroom with the last one).

1)  It looks like Android apps generally do not need a ""main"" loop (such as int main() in C-like languages, or void loop() in Arduino, or OnUpdate() in Unity), but instead transitions by calls in the [Activity Lifecycle](https://developer.android.com/guide/components/activities/activity-lifecycle.html).  Is this true even within the Activity Running area of the flow chart?

2)  If (1) is correct, then how does logic flow within the app?  Is there an external loop that  runs iterations and checks for changes; that is, when the program executes the last line on the iteration, does it go into holding until an event (such as OnPress()  or equivalent), or does it go back to the first instruction (such as a while(true) loop)?

3)  It's being made apparent to me that Android has a *lot* of variations, much more than I had initially thought.  Does anywhere have a compilation of ""common"" test cases for various mobile devices?  That is, rather than testing on every emulator every time I make a change, is there a set of devices that encapsulate most devices (such as largest screen, most dense screen, smallest screen, least dense screen...)?

4)  Initially, I had planned on programming the logic first with a command-line response to test functionality as I go.  However, it doesn't appear this is supported out-of-the-box in Android Studio.  Is the best practice to make a minimal GUI that can be emulated (essentially just a text box or two) and create an interfacing class between my logic and the GUI?  Or is there a better method I am not aware of?

5)  In order to share replays, and since there will be a small amount of possible cards (about 10/player), I am planning to have a text string that can be written/read that contains the events of the game (or at least allows recreation of the state of the game with some basic logic rules).  Would this be a standard way to do it, or is there a better known method?

3783,My results using AGP 2.5.0 ap2 and gradle 4.0,"So I wanted to try to move to using AGP 2.5.0 ap2 and gradle 4.0 because of speed improvements. Rebuilding my project is killer. I have a typical setup (working on a MBP with a few apps open) but of course I can't account for things like CPU throttling or anything but I've tried to make the two comparisons as identical as possible.

Also note that moving over made me lose two days of dev time because of an ""android-apt"" warning that (while correct) took me down the wrong path. Long story short, if you use dagger, realm or butterknife make sure you move to the new versions of each and use the new annotationCompile vs apt. I had to jump from butterknife v7 to v8 and realm v1 to v3.







**Setup A:**

    classpath 'com.android.tools.build:gradle:2.4.0-alpha6'
    distributionUrl=https\://services.gradle.org/distributions/gradle-3.4.1-all.zip

to 

**Setup B:**

    classpath 'com.android.tools.build:gradle:2.5.0-alpha-preview-02'
    distributionUrl=https\://services.gradle.org/distributions-snapshots/gradle-4.0-20170417000025+0000-all.zip

**Setup A:**

    build &gt; clean project: 40.335 secs
    run button: 1 mins 58.946 secs
    Changing my action bar title string in MainActivity &gt; Run: 48.108 secs
    Changing my action bar title string in MainActivity &gt; Instant Run: 1 mins 0.645 secs

**Setup B:**

    build &gt; clean project: 34s
    run button: 1m 31s
    Changing my action bar title string in MainActivity &gt; Run: 43s
    Changing my action bar title string in MainActivity &gt; Instant Run: 37s

So basically



A | B
-|-
40s | 34s
1m 59s | 1m 31s
48s | 43s
1m 1s | 37s

Still most disappointing is that ""Instant Run"" still takes 37 seconds in the best case. Just wanted to share that this wasn't the results I was hoping for. I know that the gradle team gives us a project to prove their results but in this ""real world"" project (3 modules, 1 module with mostly all the code), dagger, realm, retrofit, butterknife, bunch of support libs, it's still fairly slow. Oh well. Till next time!

I have a yearish of programming experience but have never made something I could put in a portfolio. So for my first portfolio idea, I could use some advice on where to look/focus my time.

I essentially want to make an app that notifies a user of the distance between them and another user. So, basically an app where me &amp; my friend can calculate the distance between each other. And both parties would have to grant permission to each other of course.

So, right off the bat I assume gps-location/coordinates would be needed, and perhaps setting up a server for both parties to send/receive the other's info? What other major android concepts would be NECESSARY to begin making this? And if possible which tools/concepts might make this idea easier for the user or easier to implement?

3801,Creating completely offline android dev environment [linux],"Hey all. Let me start by saying I have 0 experience with Android development and everything I know I have learned today, which isn't very much. So, please forgive me if whatever I say is off base.

I am to create an Android app completely offline. The reasons why aren't important, but this is the task I am dealing with. I am finally getting some semblance of a dev environment set up on my offline machine, I have the SDK, appropriate jdk stuff, Android Studio, etc. 

Enter gradle. It seems as though this build service (right?) essentially requires an internet connection to work properly. I am aware of the --offline flag, but I do not want to have to move a VM back and forth to an internet connection to handle whatever dependencies end up being required. I find it odd that the dependencies for even a basic hello world app aren't shipped with all of the required software, but I digress. 

It seems like the best way forward is to do what I do with other repos and just mirror my own. Does anyone know of a way to do this? All of the resources I'm finding are a little outdated. Is this even a feasible idea? Am I a big dumb idiot?

3809,How should Mockito's spy be used?,"Use of `spy`has been a recurring discussion at work. I am against it in all forms, whereas another dev would use it for most unit tests.

Spy lets you mock parts of a class, without mocking the whole class. It can be used to mock other methods of the class under test while still using the real implementation of other methods.

**Argument against**

Classes should be tested as a unit against their dependencies. Using `spy` to mock methods of the class under test leads to protected methods instead of private ones, leads to verifying a class's implementation (which can change without changing behavior), makes unit tests brittle, and is wont to false positives and/or false negatives when a class is changed.

**Argument for**

Unit tests are testing methods and the unit test is simple and easy to understand when you treat other methods as dependencies and mock them. Using `spy` allows you to fake a certain state in a way that's much simpler than having to manipulate a class into a state before beginning the test.

&amp;nbsp;

3844,Why use Moshi over Gson?,"I love Gson. It's simple and does exactly what you want to do. The only critique I have is that JsonElement and family aren't serializable or parcelable. So when I heard about Moshi, I couldn't help but wonder what could it possibly do better than Gson?

I read [Jesse Wilson's write-up on medium.](https://medium.com/square-corner-blog/moshi-another-json-processor-624f8741f703)

Am I missing something? The only benefit is strict mode is on by default.
It seems like his main problem is that gson doesn't over-reach. For example he argues that Gson doesn't correct the fact that the Date class doesn't encode the time zone. However that's not it's responsibility. If you want smart parsing like that you register a type-adapter that does that?

Is there some benefits I'm missing, because right now it just looks like Square just wrote a worst implementation?",1494645030.0,2017-05-13 03:10:30,60.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/androiddev/comments/684flw/why_use_moshi_over_gson/

It's starting to make sense to me and Im really enjoying this, but I'm curious if seasoned Android developers start from complete scratch when making new projects or if they use old code/templates to jump start it? Which might be better? 

As a beginner going through these projects on Udacity I very often have to look at old code to see how to implement an onClickListener or how to extend an ArrayAdapter to a custom class. I can't help but get a little upset when I can't remember how to do it all off the top of my head, so I'm curious if pros have to look over old code to jog their memory &amp; if they use old code to start an entirely new project? If, not, what is the best practice?

3892,Intercepting/Debugging 3rd party Intents,"I'm an experienced software engineer, but my Android-experience is pretty minimal.

I want to make an app that triggers various activities through push notifications, where these activities are from a third party application.

I have the whole notification/trigger system work, but I'm having a hard time getting some of the specific intents to work!

One example: I want to deep link to a title on Netflix for Android TV. I can see most intent data in logcat from when I deeplink from the launcher, but when my app sends an identical as possible intent, Netflix opens but does not launch the media! 
Here is what I see in logcat when launching something from Netflix:
&gt; I/ActivityManager: START u0 {act=android.intent.action.VIEW dat=netflix://title/70140358 flg=0x10000020 cmp=com.netflix.ninja/.MainActivity (has extras)} from uid 10019 on display 0

I try an intent like this:
&gt;  intent://title/80117470#Intent;scheme=netflix;component=com.netflix.ninja/.MainActivity;action=android.intent.action.VIEW;end

It opens Netflix to it's previous state, and does not deep link or start playing any media.

The possible issues I can think of:

1. Netflix only listens to intents from the Launcher(and not from my app)
2. I'm missing some intent Extras that are required(so how do I find these?)

Any ideas?


Bonus Question: Can I play/pause the active media(say..netflix) from my own service/broadcast receiver?

----

This thread is for simple questions that don't warrant their own thread (although we suggest checking the sidebar, [the wiki](http://www.reddit.com/r/androiddev/wiki/), or [Stack Overflow](http://stackoverflow.com) before posting). Examples of questions:

* How do I pass data between my Activities?
* Does anyone have a link to the source for the AOSP messaging app?
* Is it possible to programmatically change the color of the status bar without targeting API 21?

**Important: Downvotes are strongly discouraged in this thread. Sorting by new is strongly encouraged.**

3935,Building with 'mm' in AOSP (Android N),"Hi folks,

before Android N, when you were building with 'mm' there was useful debug info, the most useful for me being the ""Install: out/blah/blah/libblah.so"" lines showing the paths to the newly generated libraries/binaries that should be pushed on the test device. 

With Android N and the introduction of ninja, when you try to build with 'mm' all I see on the terminal is a single debug line. While this leads to less clutter and such, it doesn't show all the updated libs/bins, It only shows the last ""Install: ...."" line. 

Is there a way to get the old style debug output with 'mm'?

Also, why on Android N I can't do ""mm -B"" anymore? this used to rebuild the whole project, but in N it does nothing.

Cheers!",1494657180.0,2017-05-13 06:33:00,2.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/androiddev/comments/68sxzw/building_with_mm_in_aosp_android_n/

3971,Rule changes: self promotion and advice posts,"After some mod discussion, there are going to be 2 major changes to the subreddit rules here on /r/androiddev.

### Self promotion is now strictly limited to **50%** of your link/self posts

Recently there has been a large uptake in users who far exceed Reddit’s 10% rule for self promotion. While we don’t want to limit to 10% (since a huge part of the community is self generated content) we’d still like to keep this to a reasonable level. We’re hoping that 50% of *post* content is a good compromise, and will diversify contributions to the subreddit.

### Any device/purchase/system/hardware/software advice posts are no longer allowed

*“What device should I buy?”, “What machine should I purchase?”, “What OS is better?”*

Single posts such as these are no longer allowed. Usually these help an individual rather than the community. We completed a [survey](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfx-tywYBBAaQZHO87NBFDw00rbN9mBv5iJMyr6zOspxFbC8w/viewanalytics) earlier that should have data for what the average reader uses in their daily development, and this will be posted in the wiki. Additional questions can be comments in the weekly questions thread.

These rules will be added immediately and violations will result in temporary or permanent bans. Please help us out and report rule breakers.

Everyone is welcome to give feedback in the comments or modmail.

Thanks!

3987,Leaving mobile development business,"Leaving mobile development, what do you think?

I have been a full-time mobile developer, completely focusing on my own apps. I managed to create several apps that makes ~$15k/month however now thinking about completely abondening my apps and the mobile development.

It feels like both Apple and Google hate developers. One of my app was randomly removed from the market for no apperant reasons. No one to reach out to, or even when you talk to someone, the people you talk to don't even know computers. An app that generates 3k/month was removed over night.

Instead of focusing on providing the best support and experience for my customers, and only worrying about my customers canceling their subscriptions because I'm not providing them a good product, I constantly worry about my apps being flagged by some Apple or Google Play bot/human (at this both I believe App Reviewers are not as smart as bots). Once you are flagged, it's over. I'm sure some of you have had good experiences, but it's completely random.

Also, making money on mobile is extremely hard, if you are charging more than 99 cents - you'll have bad reviews, no matter what.

So now I'm thinking about abondening mobile development and completely moving over to web. It's much easier to charge and provide better experience on the web. No BS/random app review process, etc. I can actually focus on providing a value to my customers instead of being wiped out of business over night by Apple or Google.

What do you think? Are there others on the same boat as me?

3999,Ripple effect before a screen transition,"Hello there, fellow devs!

Let me draw you a picture: you have a bunch of touch enabled Views, each leading to other screens (via fragment, activity, or whatever you like); this is a very commonplace scenario, right? Any master-detail GUI ever is an example of this.

Let's proceed: when the user touches one of the Views, you generally want to give him a visual feedback about having performed the touch action (ripple, highlight, whatever), but you also definitely want to show him the content he asked for as early as possible, without unnecessary delays; right? Well, we know that transition animations help a lot to achieve both ends at the same time, but they can be a bit of an overkill and quite expensive to implement if you're short on time. So what would a simpler solution be? 

I decided to take a look at a few of Google's apps and compare their behaviour:

- Drive has the ripple effect play on touch, but if the requested action is very fast (navigating through folders, as opposed to opening an actual file), the fragment transaction happens before the ripple effect can even start. So they end up with inconsistent feedback.

- The same happens on most Navigation Drawers: on occasion, the transaction is so fast that the highlight on the selected navigation item isn't shown in time. Other times, it is. Entirely depending on how long it takes for the system to prep the new screen.

- Gmail entirely foregoes ripples and highlights on the touched view, instead showing a nice ""expand"" animation while transitioning from the master list to the detail screen of a particular email.

- Hangouts is the most interesting case: I was very surprised to notice that, after clicking a contact's View (or an ongoing discussion's View) in the master list, it actually looks like they added an artificial delay with the purpose of showing the ripple before actually transitioning to the requested detail screen.

Would you feel comfortable implementing such a thing? Is there a way to implement a delay in an elegant way? What's a better solution in your opinion (outside of super cool material animations, obviously)",1497049878.0,2017-06-09 23:11:18,11.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/androiddev/comments/696rhc/ripple_effect_before_a_screen_transition/

4007,"New to Android dev, I have to make a tracking app. Is it me or is Android way too complex? :( [rant]","Hi, I'm new to Android Dev. I have to make a ""simple"" Android app (or so I thought) - just track the user's position every X minutes, and send its position through an HTTP request to a server. That's it.

Now here is my journey. I might write many inacurrate stuff because I am a newb. Feel free to correct me, I would appreciate it.

Even though I am new to Android, I expected to be able to do this very fast (1 week max). It's just one screen with an ""allow tracking On/Off"" checkbox, and maybe a notification that stays sticked and says ""Device is currently tracked"".

I am having so much trouble just to do that...
When the device goes to sleep mode, it appears GPS isn't working anymore. Sometimes my activity is cleared (to clear ram I guess) but my location service is still running and sending requests. And so when I reopen my app, a new service is created and requests are sent two times, or the activity is killed but the notification remains, and so on... Tons of things like that I can't predict. It's a bug fest for something that looked so trivial to do :(

Just to get the location, it appears there are two ways: Fused Location Provider and regular Location Manager thing... To make it easier I used [this library](https://github.com/mrmans0n/smart-location-lib) that can choose the best and use both. But I can't get whether or not my service is running with that library I guess and thus sometimes it will run 2 times for example.

So I figured I have to use wake lock thing to turn on the screen from times to time apparently so the phone keeps responding. And that's another service I have to do and manage and make sure it's turned off when my user doesn't want to be tracked...

Just to do an HTTP request I had to use a library because it's so complex to do in ""pure"" android. The ""official"" recommended library Volley seemed good but I couldn't find how to do a ""direct"" request that's not async. So I picked another one, OkHttp3, which did it. I expected to be able to do a request in like one line at the beginning.

I find the documentation to be really underwhelming. In the location part nothing was written about sleep mode. The Volley part is missing some stuff like ""how do I do a request that's not async"".

And overall all seems so complex... I checked how to do server sync stuff in case I wanted to keep offline datas and saw the Sync Adapter documentation. Totally overwhelming... Have to write a million lines of code for something that should just be easy (in my opinion)...

Things like SharedPrefs seem good, but I have to write tons of lines of code. I would make it singleton, but I need to have a Context and since there is no built-in dependency injection I have to inject a context everytime and in the end it's like my singleton is just a group of static methods and it just looks like crap. It reminds me of PHP 20 years ago.

I know Java is verbose and I have no problem with it, but this 
 is a whole new level.

Obviously I suck at Android but I can't find good ressources. The official documentation (training) is missing too much stuff and just checking the javadoc isn't enough. Apparently I can't even reorder my xml views by adding nested folders?

Debugging is a nightmare. GPX/KML I find online are too slow, the car doesn't move fast enough, there is no default GPS data playback presets. The emulator often crashes randomly. I can't make instant run working.

The only things I like are Gradle and Android Studio.

Do you have any advice?
This is a nightmare.

4043,What is your view on a Singleton class than handles all database transactions?,"As someone that learnt most of what he knows about Android development through the Big Nerd Ranch's Android Programming book, I tend to follow their methods in all of my applications, one of these methods is the central repository for all data storage and database transaction, for the readers of those books, the ""CrimeLab"" class.

Another guide I used to learn Android development is StackOverflow (shocking), and there is something that 99% of the contributors of StackOverflow agree on is ""No Global Variables, No Singletons"", but it always seem to me that it makes sense to make a class that has all the functions of adding to/editing/removing from the database, and I make it a singleton because that same class I keep in it some constants that while I can use the instance of the class to manipulate the database, I can also use it for things that I will constantly use, as to how I will not need to repeat these constants over several classes.

Also Android Studio never fails in reminding everytime I access that class how that static fields are memory leak hazards.

What do you think about this? How do you handle your usual database transactions? Do you think a Singleton is justified in this?

4080,Xamarin: Doing network layer Right(TM) [X-post r/xamarindevelopers],"**Network layer in Xamarin apps**

**Introduction**

How to handle network calls in mobile apps is a common problem.

* You need to ensure you're using the platform-specific optimized network api calls to get SPDY, GZIP, etc.
* * On iOS this means NSUrlSession
* * On Android this means OkHttp
* You need to have a retry mechanism if the server is unresponsive
* You need to have a caching layer to
* * Minimize network usage, as connections are often metered
* * Improve performance
* * Handle unresponive servers / endpoints / no internet connection
* You need to handle the Cold Start problem: the very first time an app is started and there is no valid internet available. You should be able to ship your app with preloaded data for a given url.

**Example time!**

Artm Fetcher solves this in a simple and easy to use manner. Use the following code in both your Android and iOS project:


    IFetcherRepositoryStoragePathService path = new FetcherRepositoryStoragePathService();
    IFetcherRepositoryService repository = new FetcherRepositoryService(path);
    IFetcherWebService web = new FetcherWebService();

    // Primary interface you should use
    IFetcherService fetcher = new FetcherService(web, repository);

    var url = new System.Uri(""https://www.google.com"");

    // (Optional) Cold start: You can ship with preloaded data, and thus avoid
    // an initial requirement for an active internet connection
    fetcher.Preload(url, ""&lt;html&gt;Hello world!&lt;/html&gt;"");

    // Try our hardest to give you *some* response for a given url. 
    // If an url has been recently created or updated we get the response from the local cache.
    // If an url has NOT recently been created or updated we try to update 
    // the response from the network. 
    // If we cannot get the url from the network, and no cached data is available, we try to use preloaded data.
    IUrlCacheInfo response = await fetcher.Fetch(url); 


**Implementation details**

Artm Fetcher uses SQLite for storing its cache. The file is called ""fetcher.db3"" by default and is stored in the apps internal storage.

Artm Fetcher implements an exponential backoff retry mechanism using Polly . Retries 5 times by default.

4087,How To Grow Beyond Android Dev?,"This question has been lurking in my mind for quite sometime now because unfortunately these days Android Dev market is highly saturated. Many hobbyist or novice developers are kinda taking the jobs off from the seasoned developers. This is true at least in third world countries because the employers require cheap work force and a seasoned developer for obvious reason isn't gonna be cheap for them. Contrary to this there are companies that prefer quality of work over the cost but that's seldom as far as most small to medium scale companies are.

Anyways even to set yourself apart from other professional developers, one must have some tricks/tools up their sleeves.

4104,Why do companies put more focus on iOS apps?,"I'm not sure if this is the best place to ask, and I am not trying to start a flame war, but maybe some developers who do both iOS development and android development can lend their thoughts.

Why does it feel like Android applications almost always have less ""polish,""  less focus, and even less QA than their iOS counterparts?

For example, there is a company called iBaby that makes baby monitors. Their iOS app is extremely well regarded. Their Android app was recently hacked by Chinese advertisers, is known for crashing randomly or not even functioning.

DirecTV now's iOS app almost always is the first to see new features, while the Android app tends to always lag behind.

Companies often focus on getting Apple TV versions of their apps out, but androidTV is forgotten. A great example of this is Udemy - google freaking owns Udemy but they haven't made the app available in androidTV, but they have had an Apple TV app for over a year.

This thread is for simple questions that don't warrant their own thread (although we suggest checking the sidebar, [the wiki](http://www.reddit.com/r/androiddev/wiki/), or [Stack Overflow](http://stackoverflow.com) before posting). Examples of questions:

* How do I pass data between my Activities?
* Does anyone have a link to the source for the AOSP messaging app?
* Is it possible to programmatically change the color of the status bar without targeting API 21?

**Important: Downvotes are strongly discouraged in this thread. Sorting by new is strongly encouraged.**

Large code snippets don't read well on reddit and take up a lot of space, so please don't paste them in your comments. Consider linking [Gists](https://gist.github.com) instead.

4227,PSA: Samsung Shared Element bug in Nougat 7.0,"I was recently made away of an animation bug on Samsung devices running Nougat 7.0 with shared element transitions. I created a github repo here: https://github.com/matt-jt/TestSharedElement that has an image of the issue and an explanation.

The master branch shows the issue, while the ""samsung_fix"" branch has a bunch of logging and a solution for this particular project. The README also has an explanation for what's occurring.

**TLDR** In the destination activity, Samsung is still mapping child views coordinates relative to their parent rather than the root, causing views to start the shared element transition in the incorrect place",1497071558.0,2017-06-10 05:12:38,53.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/androiddev/comments/6aemuc/psa_samsung_shared_element_bug_in_nougat_70/

4230,Google Play console - many malfunctions and bugs,"I have several issues with google play console, can you please check if it's also your case?

**1) Download reports -&gt; Financial -&gt; Earning reports**

All reports from february/march 2017 are broken. I can't see product id there (it disappeared), so I can't do any statistics by myself or so...Funny thing is, in february report approximately 50% of my purchases did not have filled Product ID (completely randomly) and from March none of them (100%).

**2) User feedback -&gt; Ratings**

Ratings for some of my apps are completely wrong (and others are fine, weird). Especially cumulative ratings are simply not correct. Somebody in Google probably failed in mathemathics class. See image below, you can even see the difference on same screen

[ratings bug!](https://drive.google.com/open?id=0BzcdnQINKYF5dWJ6b3RzX05EMGs)

**3) where is their support line?**

I wrote them several times about my issues, they never replied back. Does developer support actually exists in Google, or that fancy schmancy company thinks, they own the world and don't need to do anything for us developers?

4327,App suspended and my developer account could be removed,"Hi,  
   Few weeks ago, I released Walls for reddit. It shows wallpaper subreddits of reddit in one app and allows to set wallpaper easily.   
   Today I received an email from Google stating that the app has violated a policy and could be removed from Play store. This is what they sent in the email:  
**After review, Walls for reddit, in.denim.wallsforreddit, has been suspended and removed from Google Play as a policy strike because it violates the sexually explicit content policy by containing images with nudity.**  

My app content rating is already 18+. Besides, the content is from reddit and there are many reddit clients whose rating is only 12+(If you are a reddit client developer, please help me understand what I did wrong and if you had faced the same problem). I also have an option in settings to hide NSFW images. NSFW images are not shown by default.
I can send a compliant email but it seems like I only have one chance to do that. If they do not agree with it, my developer account could be removed. This is devastating as I am an indie developer and money from apps is my sole source of income.  
If you have faced the same problem, please help me to solve  this problem.

@Subcomponent(modules = ...)

  @Subcomponent.Builder
  public abstract class Builder extends AndroidInjector.Builder&lt;YourActivity&gt; {}

4402,Adjusting IAP per country based on GDP?,"Hey /r/androiddev

So I find it ridiculous that an IAP that costs in the states $1 would cost the same e.g. in Thailand. Like I'd rather expect to base it on something like the cost of a simple meal or similar. If a cup of coffee in the states is $5, and in Thailand $1.5 then that should be also reflected in IAPs.

I've seen that Steam adjusts pricing country-wide automatically, e.g. games cost half the price in Russia for example.

But I don't see any info on that except doing it manually, can that be? Do you know of any such examples for Google Play?

Bonus question : And how to adjust them automatically? Doesn't seem to be an export/import feature for pricing templates in Google Play Console. So having to scroll manually through a list of 50 countries for every price point seems a bit overkill.

4407,Offline-first with sync: best way to approach this?,"So as an overview of what I'm trying to accomplish:

I'm looking to build an Android app and web-based admin portal to manage jobs across a number of maintenance workers. Essentially, job requests would come in via a back-end system, have a small workflow-type process on the admin side, and then get pushed out to a worker. that has an account That worker can then make modifications (e.g. change a quoted price) and then it gets synced back to the record for that request on the back-end.

The main issue is that network connectivity is extremely sporadic so we'd need something that works best offline and incorporates real-time functionality as well. I've been looking at Realm Mobile Platform as it incorporates a lot that I like but the web-admin side is extremely important and I'm not sure about keeping ALL that data in a DB that isn't as open or well-researched as Postgres or Mongo.

Any suggestions on how to go about approaching this?",1497146328.0,2017-06-11 01:58:48,21.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/androiddev/comments/6bh31s/offlinefirst_with_sync_best_way_to_approach_this/

After reading this news (https://torrentfreak.com/netflix-use-of-google-drm-means-rooted-android-devices-are-banned-170515/), I'm wondering how can they filter the APK availability based on device rooted status.

Could be a new (*and hidden feature*) only available for developers using Widevine based on what they called *Certified Widevine Implementation Partner*? Anyone knows more about it?.

Honestly, it's not fair that only Widevine clients can use this kind of advanced filtering features, it should be available for everyone. What do you think?

4439,SlidingTutorial-Android - Library for making animated tutorials inside your app,"Let me introduce one of our projects. The Sliding tutorial for Android is a simple library for creating tutorials for any application on the Android platform.

Two *main tasks* of our library:

1. From page to page the background color should gradually change. It means, that one color transformed into another with the gradient effect.

2. In turn, each element on the screen is moved in the intended direction and to the predetermined point. Developer sets as he wishes:

* the background color of each page;
* the initial order of elements;
* the direction to slide the element;
* shifting coefficient of elements.

The library is created using the parallax effect. It looks fresh and eye-catching. With its use, website or application looks more attractive and interesting.

Don’t hesitate to try it and we will be glad to receive your feedback!

Great! A human responded to me. Probably just gonna be a day or two now...
Nope.

Fast forward to yesterday, 11 days later, still no response. I decided to contact them via chat to remind them once again. This is their response:

&gt; &gt;I'm sorry I cannot assist on the matter as I am not part of the Policy Team, however I will forward this case to the Policy specialist requesting an update on your appeal, please be assured a Policy specialist will respond to your appeal, unfortunately the Policy Team have received a high volume of appeals they're working on your case.

... And here I am. It's just been a day since the last interaction, but frankly I don't expect any response any time soon.

But given the fact that people are always scared of something new (especially if they only knew Java their entire career, such as myself), I just feel like I need to know some things before I can start feeling positive about Kotlin:

 * Does any Java library needs to be re-written to make it work in Kotlin environment? [Google has explicitly said that Kotlin and Java will work together](https://developer.android.com/kotlin/faq.html). But is this true in all cases? What about annotation processing libraries like [ButterKnife](https://github.com/JakeWharton/butterknife) or [Parceler](https://github.com/johncarl81/parceler)?
 * Will Android itself be re-written in Kotlin? Can we expect the next release of support library in Kotlin?

4523,"In Rx, should API calls be Singles or Observables of Started, Success, Error events?","Im trying to refactor app.

Should API requests be Single or rather Observable of Started, Success, Error events (with onError should never occur)?

Current state is IntentService with Started event posted by EventBus, synchronous api call, Success event or Error event.

The latter sounds like a better fit (+ Jake Whartons talk https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0IKHxjkgop4&amp;feature=youtu.be), but then how would one do say saving to database after the api call? I would have to have if instanceof Success in doOnNext. Feels weird.

4562,Android+Kotlin: my experience,"Hello fellow developers

I thought I would write a little about my first experience writing an app using only Kotlin.


I had a idea for an app that I could use myself, and I decided I would try making it in Kotlin because I've been hearing a lot about it recently. I looked like a real modern take on a JVM compatible language.
I've been using Swift on iOS for a couple of years, and Kotlin seemed like something along those lines.
Anyway, here goes:


The installation of the Kotlin plugin is straight forward. No issues whatsoever.
Then comes the coding. I was surprisingly easy to get started, but one thing that I couldn't figure out was static fields. Turns out, one has to create this thing called a companion object.
So, I like to have a static method called open on my Activities. This lets me clearly display which parameters an Activity needs to present itself.


Example:


    class DetailsActivity : BaseActivity() {

    //snip: Rest of the class....

        companion object {

            fun open(c: Context, model: MyModelClass) {

                val detailsIntent = Intent(c, DetailsActivity::class.java)

                detailsIntent.putExtra(MyModelClass.EXTRA_NAME, model)

                c.startActivity(detailsIntent)

            }

        }

    }

When this companion object is created, I have the option of calling my Activity like this:
DetailsActivity.open(this, myModel)


Another thing that I would like to mention, is Kotlin's super nice feature for null-check:

Instead of doing the whole 

    if(someObject != null)

        someObject.doWork();

In Kotlin you just have to do

    someObject?.doWork()


Isn't that neat?



I had a great time getting to know Kotlin and you any of you have any questions - ask them :)

The IDE support is FANATASTIC. If you copy/paste Java code from somewhere it is AUTOMATICALLY converted to Kotlin syntax upon pasting!! Thank you, JetBrains!


I really like how seamless the integration is with existing Java classes. There's no doubt in my mind, that every new class in my existing project is written in Kotlin. 


One thing is for sure - all my apps going forward are written in Kotlin. I feel really productive with that language.

&amp;nbsp;


Oh, one thing - I was a little weary on how big the Kotlin additional runtime components would do to the final apk size. But I was surprised to see that my resulting apk has a size of about 9MB. Granted, all icons are also made with vector drawables. But I think the added weight is negligible.

&amp;nbsp;


I do hope that you have found this post inspiring, and again feel free to ask me something in the comments.

&amp;nbsp;



If anybody is interested, here's a link to the app I wrote in Kotlin:
&amp;nbsp;


Basically it's a map of Tesla's Supercharger locations around the world.

4618,Using Android Gradle plugin 3.0.0-alpha1 with IntelliJ 2017.2 EAP,"Hey all - just wanted to mention that I ran into an issue yesterday when trying to sync with the new plugin inside IntelliJ 2017.2.

If you attempt it right now, you'll likely see the following:

&gt; Error: This Gradle plugin requires Studio 3.0 minimum

Now, I thought that was pretty silly since I was technically using a version of the IntelliJ platform _higher_ than what AS 3.0 is based on, but figured it may have been due to customization on behalf of the Android Tools team to AS that broke compatibility (and worst case, I'd be waiting until those changes made it to the open source IntelliJ Android plugin).

Anyway, stubborn as I am, I dug through the sources of the Gradle plugin and its dependencies until I finally found a workaround. A version check is in place in `ModelBuilder` that is fed by Gradle properties inserted by the IDE when you execute the Sync action. The fix is to add the following to `gradle.properties`:

    android.injected.build.model.only.versioned=3

AS 3.0 is sending the value `3`, whereas older versions as well as IntelliJ send `1` or lower, if they send a value at all. Once set as specified, sync works again and everything so far has been operating normally.",1497159146.0,2017-06-11 05:32:26,10.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/androiddev/comments/6c71av/using_android_gradle_plugin_300alpha1_with/

4629,In what circumstances may Clean Architecture be considered over-engineering or unsuitable?,"We developed a fairly large project with 26 independent modules. And we built it using clean architecture principles. Over a period of time, when new requirements started coming in with shorter deadlines, we were questioning if it is wise to adopt clean architecture for such work environments. We certainly benefited and learnt a good deal from the transition, but building business entities and mapping them to outer layer models (a lot of times even the business entities had to be updated according to changes in the existing web APIs), developing use cases for each functionality and with the painfully slow gradle builds, it became a much less enjoyable experience quickly. 

This is how we structured the project -

* Isolating big features as project modules.
* Each small feature (for example - add, delete update task) were split with respective use cases in the same module.
* Mapping business entities to the outer layer entities after fetching data from the repository.
* And a single/ dedicated repository (singleton) for each module - In most cases we fetched data from cache first, local storage next and then network if necessary.
* And lastly injecting all dependencies manually (without dagger).
* Thanks to OkBuck, we got around slightly improving the apk building experience.

Will appreciate opinions and suggestions :)

4676,Demand for a Kotlin Community Style Guide?,"After watching Christina's part of the Kotlin is Here talk at I/O this year (if you haven't watched it, please do), it occurs to me that Kotlin does not have a comprehensive official style guide. An important part of on-boarding is having a style guide so that developers can get up to speed quicker and write better code.

While every company should maintain their own set of style guidelines, it probably makes sense to have a good, forkable, jumping off point.

If there's interest here, I'm willing to lay the framework for a general Kotlin style guide that could become a *de facto* Kotlin Community Style guide. This guide would (of course) be open source and open for discussion. Before I put out a 1.0 release, I would open it up to a serious feedback round from the community here and elsewhere. Feedback, of course, would be accepted at all times, but would be particular important before a 1.0 release.

What's everyone's thoughts? Would you guys be interested in such a style guide?

Edit: OK, there's demand. What else was I expecting? I'll make this my lunch project (I do a thing while I'm eating lunch at my desk), and I'll also have direct conversations with another Kotlin developer I know to make sure my opinions aren't weird.

4692,"""Could not extract private data"" error when running app","This is more for my curiosity since I'd just like to learn the cause behind this problem. Hopefully this kind of question is allowed. I'm not a developer, but I ran into this issue once when trying to run an app from an indie dev. This was a known issue for the app that only occurred on Android 7.0 apparently. Also, having the app installed before updating to Android 7 lets the app run fine on Android 7.0. If installed on Android 7.0 initially, the app would just display this error and then crash after showing the first screen for a second or two. 

My question is what triggers the ""Could not extract private data"" error? What changed in the Android 7.0 update to cause this? I've tried googling it and it has to do with lacking internal storage. However, the app I was downloading was less than 1 GB in size and I had 12 GB available.",1497165526.0,2017-06-11 07:18:46,1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/androiddev/comments/6cjz3k/could_not_extract_private_data_error_when_running/

4708,About the updated Google Malicious Behavior Policy?,"Hi guys,
I am quite new to this all Android stuff and my English is not that good, it is OK but it is not pro and I need your help because I don't quite understand all the changes and I don't want to get banned or my apps deleted so I have a few questions:
The link of the policy is here: https://play.google.com/about/privacy-security/malicious-behavior/

1. If I have an app that uses sync feature to make changes to a page without pushing a new update every day, is that against the rules? Because if I disable the sync feature and I make a error in typing or have a broken link, I will have to publish a compete new update just to fix that one error and people will have to download the new updated version just to fix the broken link? 
2. What is gonna happen to the m-banking and shopping apps that rely on the constant sync because you can't wait a week for a new update to see your bank account or to see your product placed in the shopping app?
3. If my app has a picture gallery and I don'h have the pictures in the apk because I uploaded the pictures to my website like www.mysite.com/app/gallery/1.jpg, www.mysite.com/app/gallery/2.jpg,  www.mysite.com/app/gallery/3.jpg and my app takes those pictures externaly and downloads them and shows them in the app - Is this against the rules? Also if I want to put a new picture, I must publish a new app version update because I can't sync my gallery page?

I really need your guys help and if you can share some of your thoughts I would really appreciate it :)
All the best guys and thanks for the help! And if I remember anything more I will post in this thread &lt;3",1497166555.0,2017-06-11 07:35:55,3.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/androiddev/comments/6cm2er/about_the_updated_google_malicious_behavior_policy/

I`m working in a Startup and they are really good people, but it's difficult to program for them because they have zero specifications. Like, none. Do your best to realize what that class do! I don't want to keep going with this XGH (extreme go horse, for the non-familiar) way of coding (I'm an intern, I want to program right), but I don't know how I should document the class. I try my best to not comment unnecessary blocks, I write self explanatory variables, but I would like to have a header to explain what the class does. The problems are:

* Does the comments compromises the overall app's performance ?
* Is it really necessary or am I being paranoid?
* If it is necessary, what is good to have at the header?

When I pass these concerns for my superiors they just ""Meh, the source code is the best documentation"". The problem is when the source code is not easily understandable and I lose a lot of time trying to understand why the hell that for is iterating the variable x.

- Getting the generated GenericLifecycleObserver from your implementation of LifecycleObserver.

There must be some kind of drawbacks and disadvantages. I had tried Xamarin a long time ago and searched for its disadvantages. The search results included ""instability"" and ""lack of community"", etc.

With this architecture, the `Repository` needs to know if the device is connected to the internet or not, or it can ping to the API URL or not. To know whether the device is connected to the internet, we need a `Context`, so below are my thoughts:

* Initialize `Repository` with `Context` in `Activity` or `Fragment`. This can be deadly when a configuration change happens, the context will be `null`.
* Pass a flag variable to `Repository` calls like `fetchItems(isOnline)`;
* Pass a `ConfigPojo` to `Repository` calls like `fetchItems(configPojo);` which will be set on the `Activity` or `Fragment` then accessed by the `Repository`.

&amp;nbsp;

What are your thoughts?

Any other suggestions?

4757,Developing the UI without xml,"I'm working on a android app, and we are moving towards programmatically developing the UI.  For instance, given a list of components, the activity will generate views based of what is in the list.  

The list will only hold data describing if it's a table, with rows and if there are any actions.  

My question is, how do you deal with different screen sizes.  I've had a look at DisplayMetrics, and i've managed to figure out how to generate a scale factor.  Which i then use to manage the padding, margin etc.  I was wondering if there's a better way?

I know i could save myself the headache of using xml, but the design's are coming from another system, which will feed the app the types of views it wants.

4764,Let's have a talk about Android Architecture Components,"Everyone seems to be pretty exited about google doing something 
about android architecture. I also generally think it's a step in 
the right direction especially for the beginners who often don't
know where to go, but I am curious what more experienced android 
devs have to say about them and how it changes your current architecture.
My humble thoughts:

Room: It looks nice, I'm happy to see them embrace SQL in full beauty :) Compile time checks are also nice 
but I would still prefer SQLDelight + SQLbrite. And you?

ViewModel: I'm still not sure about the idea of ViewModel/Presenter not having reference to view
so you need to clutter your activity/fragment with subscribing code.

Lifecycle/LiveData: I'm a big fan of conductor and it's simplification of fragment concept(lifecycle) 
but it looks like there is more and more reasons to fight with fragments and get some of the first party
benefits like the new Dagger AndroidInjection support and now the lifecycle handling for other lifecycle
aware components.

4780,"Android vitals and Google Play “promotability""","I was wondering if anyone has actually heard Google mention the claims articles such as this are making: http://www.androidauthority.com/googles-new-punishment-poorly-made-apps-774032/ These articles mention apps falling below the 25% threshold in Android vitals metrics falling in ranking in the Play Store (as if the vitals are included in the ranking algorithm itself). I have listened to the I/O conference and the Game Developers Conference mentioned in these articles and they don't mention anything about this - only about how falling down in these measurements can result in 1-star ratings.

The reason I ask is because my app is appearing to be in the bottom 25% for Slow Rendering and Frozen Frames, even though it appears silky smooth on similar hardware as the test devices in real world use. It seems it would take massive amounts of development time to improve these numbers - as my initial analysis using 'GPU Rendering Info' apparently shows that most similar apps are above 16ms rendering time for the majority of frames, and I have no instant feedback as to whether my efforts would actually improve things on the test devices.

So I would like to ignore these indicators - my app has a 4.5 rating and 4.7 in the last 3 months and none of the feedback I receive says anything about rendering speed - they just want more features. Focusing on these measurements would be a huge waste of time. 

It appears Google is aware of the some of the limitations of these measurements (ie - ""Note that some apps require long wake locks to enable their core functionality such as streaming music. "") so I'm not sure how they intend to fairly bring down the ranking of some apps that fall in the bottom 25%.",1497172350.0,2017-06-11 09:12:30,2.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/androiddev/comments/6cxrik/android_vitals_and_google_play_promotability/

Is this the right approach to move the persistent data to viewmodel from your presenters ?

We are building our app using an MVVM architecture, and I am proposing to keep our ViewModels clean from Android related code. Now some of my colleagues oppose this, saying this is too much of a restriction and they should be allowed to use Android related code, such as Context in the ViewModel when necessary. 

My first go to argument would be; well that creates ViewModels that we can't test. But one of my colleagues told me that Robolectric doesn't need to actually run on a device since it only mocks the SDK. So my question is: What is the real disadvantage of using Robolectric for unit tests? If there are no immediate disadvantages, is my argument still valid? Why not allow the Context to be used once in a while if it is really necessary?

4802,"An Unofficial ""My Team Switched to Kotlin and Here's How It Happened"" MAGAThread (Make Android Great Again)","So, with the huge news of Kotlin being officially supported by Google, there are obviously going to be a much greater number of teams switching to the language, for very apparent reasons. We know Kotlin has huge benefits over Java, and a multitude of teams have switched over and have been using Kotlin in production for some time now. My biggest reservation, despite the huge list of reasons to switch, was the lack of official support. I know, I know, JetBrains + IntelliJ + Android == Android Studio and so everything is just going to continue working, but I just couldn't make the switch without official support. 

Now that Google has come out and supported Kotlin, I made a (admittedly rather weak) pitch to the team that we should begin folding in Kotlin in areas that made sense. Things like external modules where there wasn't any heavy logic, but were rather there for analytics, or perhaps in our models themselves, but the response I receive was a quite reasonable, ""Let's wait 6 months and make sure it's mature enough before we dedicate resources to integration."" I should also note that there are other situations that are much more important we tackle now. Essentially what I'm saying is that I think management and our team are making the right decision (for us) by waiting, but understand that isn't the case for each team. I'm very excited to begin using it more and more and continue learning how it can make programming super fun and enjoyable again, rather than dealing with ceremonious boilerplate land that is Java. 

# So thus begins my question for the community

*  How did your team begin using Kotlin? 
*  Has your team begun using Kotlin yet? 
*  What did you do to spur along this decision?
*  What feature of the language was the preverbial straw that broke the camel's back when it came to making the switch?
*  Is there anything you would do differently when switching if you had to do over again?
*  Has Kotlin truly increased your team's efficiency or is it just more fun to write code?
*  How did you deal with the blocking nature of learning a new technology so core to the product that, without knowledge, a team member can no longer contribute unless they attain said knowledge?

Please note that these are a small subset of questions relevant to making such an enormous change to your team's process. I would love to hear from you all about any of your thoughts about making the switch. Also, I mentioned teams, but what about Indie Developers as well? I'd love to hear from everyone in the community about their ""transitioning experience.""",1497174407.0,2017-06-11 09:46:47,9.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/androiddev/comments/6d1vy7/an_unofficial_my_team_switched_to_kotlin_and/

4833,I've released simple browser game. One day later i've uploaded Android port to Google Play. Google detected it's same game and suspended it until i've appealed with proof that it was my game.,"Looks like Google now is preventing for unathorized clones of games which are already published outside Google Play. Even small and uknown ones.

**18th May** i've published my simple web game. Made in HTML5.

**19th May** i've uploaded native port of this game to Google Play. Same graphics, same name, different code.

After longer than usual review i've received e-mail that my game has been suspended for violating the impersonation policy.

My first thought? Somebody stolen my browser game, converted it to app, and uploaded it to Google Play before me. I've quickly appealed, writing that i own idea, domain and uploaded proof (screenshot from my domain provider).

23th May my game has been reinstated. After further e-mails i know it's because they couldn't know if i was author of web game or i had rights to port it.

My game name is same as web game url, so it was easy to find with automated search. That probably triggered manual review which confirmed it was same game.

Now i know that i should have contacted Google before uploading my game. There is form for uploading such things before uploading your app.

I just didn't thought Google is checking for such things. My web version wasn't even 2 days online. It wasn't popular or anything.

Anyway, this whole experience was positive for me. Now i know that if i would be lucky and made viral browser game i don't have to be worried that someone will upload it to Google Play before me.

Remember 2048? After whole success with web version, dozen clones started to appear in Google Play. Author of web version uploaded his port about one month later. At that time other clones probably already had millions of downloads. Maybe today whole situation would look different.

**Edit:**

I didn't want to write my game name because intention of this post wasn't promoting it. But now i think that it may be important. My game name is Swappy 10 and browser version url is http://swappy10.com

So my browser version was published under top level domain (.com). I'm not sure what would happen if it would be published under different domain (for example somegameportal.com/swappy10 ) even if it would be easily searchable using just it's name.",1497177603.0,2017-06-11 10:40:03,82.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/androiddev/comments/6d81mk/ive_released_simple_browser_game_one_day_later/

I kept getting interviews for Android development but would never get the job either due to messing up an algorithm question or not having enough experience so I thought I needed something more substantial out there. I've still got a long way to go and it's not perfect so would appreciate some advice on how I can improve. For example, I'm sure there's some edge cases in my UI tests that I've missed.

It uses modern libraries in a larger-than-sample app if you want to see an attempt at modern architecture in a non-sample setting.

4862,Another Entrepreneur advice with a day job thread,"I have a free Android app that is a fairly unique concept that I released 9 months ago. 

It seems to be gaining some traction but not as much as I would have hoped yet. I have about 5k users that have signed into the app since release.

Obviously the app needs much higher growth before I can starting making any money off advertising and IAP. I think with a lot more feature development, apple support and more marketing could accelerate the growth quite a bit but who knows really. 

Now here is my dilemma. My programmer day job is a cake walk and its remote. But since my app has not taken the world by storm the doubt has come. I am starting to wonder if its time to leave the day job before it damages my career too much. 

The reasons why the day job is an issue:

- I'm 25-30% below market pay.

- I'm under terrible leadership 

- My career growth while working here has stagnated. 

- Coding skills are not growing at the rate they should be and would be at other companies.


The reason why the day job is good for me:

- Its much easier to be an entrepreneur due to the hours and being remote.
- Its a very easy gig and its from home.

Programming for myself (like everyone) is preferred but that's not always realistic. Obviously I can only make this decision for myself.

In this course you’ll learn the basics of Kotlin by building a headless solitaire app. It’s a ton of fun, and I had an absolute blast making it. Not only that, it’s also a really good course; it even made [the official list of Kotlin resources](https://developer.android.com/kotlin/resources.html#videos)!

4931,android-sdk-installer Command Line Tool,"Hey peoples.


It is sometimes difficult to get a build environment to build Android projects properly. Somewhat recently, [sdkmanager](https://developer.android.com/studio/command-line/sdkmanager.html) was released which made it a bit easier  to install needed components via command line. 

&amp;nbsp;

But, as of right now, certain build systems such as travis-ci still use older methods to install components, which means things like `cmake` are not available for install with the default configuration.
  
&amp;nbsp;  

[android-sdk-installer](https://github.com/Commit451/android-sdk-installer) is a command line Ruby project which makes it easier to configure Android builds on a CI server. It was created mostly for a project that is hosted on both GitHub and GitLab, allowing similar SDK installation between the two CI platforms.

&amp;nbsp;

https://github.com/Commit451/android-sdk-installer

&amp;nbsp;
  
Hopefully others will find use of this, for builds which require multiple CI configurations, builds on travis which require additional tools provided by sdkmanager, or just as a tool to use on your own custom CI server. We also have created a [docker image](https://hub.docker.com/r/commit451/android-sdk-installer/) if that is your CI cup of tea.

I understand the push for bottom bar instead of tabs on top, what I do not understand full, what is reasoning behind removing swipe for page changing. Is it only optimization? Lack of  'page selection' at start? Or there are some other reasons i don't see. 

Not the biggest fan of viewpager myself.. but curious if there is some specific reason for those changes lately. I know iOS  is not using swipe in bottom bar either but if i understand correcltly its just not in widget itself. In android it could be just viewpager with tabs on bottom.

4943,Computer Scientists Back Google in Oracle vs. Google Dispute over Android [how many names do you recognize?],"Full text available [here](https://www.eff.org/files/2017/05/31/2017.05.30_computer-scientists-fair-use-amicus-brief_oracle_v_google.pdf). 

Summary:

&gt; The software industry has long relied on and benefitted from the open nature of application programming interfaces (APIs). This openness enabled innovations in computing hardware, operating systems, programming languages, internet network protocols, and cloud  computing. The long-standing and prevailing industry custom is open  access to API reimplementation. Affirming the principle that API  reimplementation is fair use will sustain interoperability, encourage  innovation, and disc ourage lock-in. 

&gt; Though this Court previously held  that APIs are copyrightable, it remanded the case because of the open question of fair use, stressing in particular that the functional nature of software APIs and their role in  interoperability may be relevant to the fair use analysis. On remand, a  jury found that Android’s use of Java APIs was fair use.   

&gt; This result should be upheld.  APIs are inherently functional, which weighs strongly in favor  of fair use and should guide the remaining fair use analysis. Android is transformative because it successfully brought the Java langua ge and its APIs into an entirely new context: smartphones and tablets. Moreover, API reimplementations enable increased interoperability, favoring fair use. 

&gt; Overruling the jury’s decision would undermine this long-established custom and practice that the computer software industry relies upon so routinely and thoroughly. We urge this Court to affirm the District Court’s judgment.

One thing that isn't clear in the presentations from Google is how to do pagination. In their docs it says not to use the Cursor API if possible.

I don't want to just dumbly load objects into memory if it can be avoided as eventually as you scroll down (for really long lists) you will exhaust all memory unless you manage the in-memory list and periodically prune it.

4987,[DEV] Getting your app ranked in the Play Store,"My app has been out for a few weeks now and wanted to celebrate a small milestone of having it reach [towards the top of the play store](https://postimg.org/image/r304hqbpn/), in the more results, by searching for dinner spinner. No it's not the end of the race by a long-shot but it is encouraging, at least for me.

So far, my best advice is to advertise on Facebook and get all your friends' support on you publishing your app. This will increase your installs substantially and you can ask family to leave some reviews. 

Another thing I have done is joined Android Facebook Groups where I advertise my app pretty much on a daily basis. Some of the people in this group will do a review exchange as well (you download and review their app and they will do the same).  Join groups related to your niche. For example, my app tailors to people who like to dine out. So naturally I go to Facebook groups, blogs, etc related to restaurant reviews.

That has been my first two-three weeks at any rate. I also advertise on other Social Media platforms - Twitter, Google Plus, LinkedIn, and obviously Reddit!

5002,SDK Tools version 26 broke the SDK and AVD Manager,"The 'Android Sdk Tools' in the SDK manager's highest version is 25 but when I'm using Android Studio there's a prompt to update it to version 26.

After updating I can't no longer open SDK and AVD manager(exe). I can still open them in Android Studio. Downgrading back to version 25 solves the problem. Is this intended by Google or a bug? By intended I mean, opening the SDK manager is only possible from Android Studio from version 26 onwards?

Reference: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/5199811/android-sdk-manager-wont-open

Version 26 has many missing files compared to version 25.

5049,Snarkiest replies without drawing Googles attention?,"Edit: I probably should not have used the term snarky because that is not what I am going for here.  I know we can't be snarky, but what can we say that would expose the idiocracy of some of these reviews.  As I alluded to below, probably nothing, and this is just about my frustration.


I'm sure everyone here gets as frustrated as I when someone posts a one-star review for the smallest of small reasons.  We know how users always feel entitled and that will never change.  They can be disrespectful and as rude with us with nothing to lose but we can't defend ourselves very much (or risk account penalties from Google).

I'm sure the answer to this is to not reply at all, but sometimes you just have to.  Sometimes defending ourselves with the truth looks good to potential new users who might read a bad review and be affected by it, so sometimes not responding isn't always good.  So my topic of conversation is this: 

What is the harshest reply you can give back to a user without being rude or dinged by Google? Examples or suggestions are welcomed.

In the end, I usually become a turtle and erase 
my original response and hide back in my shell and simply say ""I'm sorry you feel this way."" Or another type of apology.",1500110785.0,2017-07-15 09:26:25,0.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/androiddev/comments/6fm55p/snarkiest_replies_without_drawing_googles/

5066,What do you think about the `LifecycleObserver` interface? Can someone help me understand the reason behind it?,"A little late to the I/O party, but I see the updated docs say that the [LifecycleObserver](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/arch/lifecycle/LifecycleObserver.html)


&gt;Marks a class as a LifecycleObserver. It does not have any methods, instead, relies on [OnLifecycleEvent](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/arch/lifecycle/OnLifecycleEvent.html) annotated methods.


One of the main purposes of adding Annotations to Java was in order to get rid of the implement-an-interface-for-metadata antipattern (example [1](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/lang/Object.html#clone--) and [2](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/io/Serializable.html)), so what's the purpose here besides ""registering"" an observer? Wouldn't an annotation or some sort of separate throwaway interface be more canonical and also free up future binary compatibility restrictions? It'd make sense if there were static utility or default methods for that specific context; or is that the entire point I'm missing? (for future interface additions I mean) 

I guess the Android Lifecycle is an entire philosophy of its own, and I also haven't gone through all of the new components yet so I could be mistaken.

5068,Caching before post,"Hi, I'm new here. I've been working on this android app that tracks odors emitted by a sanitation facility in my hometown. The app allows the user to complete an odor description form, and posts the data to a server where it can be stored and retrieved to be displayed on a heat map. I want the data to be cached based on the connection strength.

I've looked into getCacheDir, and that seems to be the key, but it returns the data in a file. I'd like the app to check the connection strength and, if it's below a certain threshold, cache the data locally to be posted later. I've read up on HTTPResponseCache a bit, but I'm not sure how to go about this task. Any suggestions?

So Ive been working at a sv startup as a fullstack engineer for over a year now and im lightly job hunting at this point


Ive been interested in android development as a hobby and would like to find a fulltime job doing it. But problem is that I get ignored for every android engineer app I put out?


I don't have any real professional android experience, just a music player app I put on the store, and also I spent a year internship working on an android app. I suspect this is why I dont get much in the way of responses.


Ive had trouble finding motivation at my current job and Ive sort of realized that it's because I dont like web development, Im sure Id have more motivation doing android stuff..


Anyway, anyone have any strategies on how to get these companies to give me a shot at an android role? should I build more android apps? kinda hard with my work schedule.

My experience level: I've made small games in unity before and some demo style apps in java/pure sdk.

Seeking: Really really looking for some guidance, links to tutorials, or generally on where to begin reading... just suggestions or the best methods out there to achieve the goal

Goal: I want to make a new app with the following purpose.
- A system that will allow one user of the app to send a virtual object to another specified user of the app. 
- a user will have server of one or more types of unique objects (class)
- The receiver will be able to accept or decline the object
- If declined the object will get returned to the senders inventory
- If accepted it will initiate a 24hr ""countdown"" for both users preventing them from sending or receiving other objects
- Objects will reset to original owners at the end of the month

I just found my app posted on Aptoide by this random ""guy/store"":

1. I downloaded the apk and it has 18MBs, my app has 6MBs...
2. I don't know for sure if it was modified.
3. I'm a small developer so I can't really take legal action....

I don't mind of the app being there, but I would like to know if it was modified to display ads and analytics for another person (denek32)

That apparently has a youtube channel:

How can I know if my app was modified to display other ads...? Any ADB commands?

I'm struggling to figure out how to get Dagger to return mocked versions of my presenters for UI testing purposes. I currently have a ""MockAppComponent"" that I replace in my test suite to return mocks / fakes of Application level injections.

5192,"How do you organize your unit, integration, system, etc. tests?","Hi everyone, 

hope it's okay if I ask the question here, if not, I do apologize.

I'm currently developing my first application with special focus on tests.
At the moment most classes are covered with unit test and dependencies are mocked out with mockito (except value objects, for that I'm using simple factories like seen in the kickstarter app). 

JVM based tests are located in the /test folder and those who need an emulator in order to work are in /androidTest. In addition to this there is a /sharedTest folder for, yeah, shared things between the two.

Now, do I just duplicated everything, move it to a folder named 'integration' , replace the mocked objects with real ones, make a few changes, create test suits and that would be alright?

5199,Account for app release,"Hi Everyone,

I am currently in the process of completing my first Android app for release in the Play Store.

Wanting to get peoples opinions on how to approach setting up Google Play Console account, would it be best to use my personal Gmail, setup a new Gmail under the name of the app.

I am also planning to release additional apps unrelated to this one in the future so would it maybe be better to setup a new account under freelance developer name and have all apps released under the one Google Play Console account?

Understand that it is really down to preference, just want to get opinions on what may be the better choice.

5227,"""Developing Android Apps"" course at Udacity is ridiculously fast.","Hi.

This is a rant from my end.  I've been trying to learn Android development and be career ready for over a year.  Believe me, it isn't laziness.  I already got the Android Basics Nanodegree and am currently going through the ""Developing Android Apps"" course, looking to get the 2nd Nanodegree for Android.  I've finished the intro tracks for Android on Treehouse and am also currently going through the Big Nerd Ranch 2nd Edition.

Udacity goes really fast and its starting to piss me off.  Not everyone can pick it up at their pace, especially someone like me who is diagnosed with ADD.  You have instructors who literally cover 5-6 concepts in one video without explaining any of them.  What is this, if not a money grab?  What is the hurry?  You charge students $199/month.  Why are you rushing?  I've read other posts by students who also think that Udacity is skimming through everything.  

Believe it or not, I'm not the one to make excuses for myself.  I like to go through multiple resources because at the end, this is my dream and I push myself for it.  For a platform as complicated and messy as Android, you really need to hold people's hands, especially if you're trying to grab their money.",1500132317.0,2017-07-15 15:25:17,0.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/androiddev/comments/6gr872/developing_android_apps_course_at_udacity_is/

For a school project I had to make a 2d game on the canvas. I chose to use Android's SurfaceView because it was recommended to me.

After searching the web for a short while, I stumbled upon this [StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/9588776/canvas-in-surfaceview-hardware-acceleration) post from 2012 where /u/RomainGuy stated that SurfaceView doesn't support hardware acceleration.

5272,How do you guys test an android app on so many devices and variety of android versions?,"Please don't call me names for asking this, I am a newbie and a non-technical guy.
Anyways, when you develop an app, how do you test for so many varieties of devices? I know about emulators, but still it seems like a never ending work to test each device on each android version. Or do you run automated tests, if yes how, with what software?

Also are there any known android version specific issues or features that you **always** make sure to test against?

For example I came across this page that talks about how android 6.0 requests permission at run time and not at app installation. https://developer.android.com/training/permissions/requesting.html?lang=en This probably causes some apps to crash that don't update their code to reflect this.

I apprecaiet your answers, and sorry if these questions are dumb, I am newbie once again.

5286,97 Reviews down to 12,"Hi there, the game I recently released on the play store and have had the reviews go from 97 to 12 [here.](http://imgur.com/AkbtZBW)

I will admit I had been messaging friends and family to download and play / review if they feel so inclined, everything that I have read lead me to get friends / family to download and play, we haven’t paid anyone or gone through any services.
 
I could understand reviews such as [this](http://i.imgur.com/HL3wyL2.png) to be removed (despite how awesome it is)

We've even lost 1 star ratings and reviews from people in countries we don't know!  So I don't really know what is happening?

I stress again, we did not, and have not paid anyone to get our games.
 
For clarification, we have contacted google, they gave us a fairly automated reply and from what we can tell after reading the terms and conditions we are doing everything legit, we just want to seek further clarification but are getting no traction, does anyone else have any idea, and is this happening to other people?

I know that this is specific and without other info you can't determine, but just as a general concept, has something like this been allowed in the past?

1. It got the info from openweather and I parsed it myself.
2. Used picasso for the image.
3. saved cities which the user chose in a database so that their weather was alredy on the screen when the app is opened.
4. Had a settings tab in the hamburger menu and FAB for future forecast.

Now I don't know what to do next. Is there other simple apps which I can try making? Also, one thing which I never learnt was how people put so many beautiful animations. Is there any place where I can learn that?

 All i can do is built in android animations like the FAB moving up when a snackbar appears using coordinator layout.

*When using Google Play App Signing, you will use two keys: the app signing key and the upload key. Google manages and protects the app signing key for you, and you keep the upload key and use it to sign your apps for upload to the Google Play Store.*

I don't understand I already have my keys locally when I generated my signed apk.. How does google get the keys ? From the signed apk I uploaded ?",1500144533.0,2017-07-15 18:48:53,3.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/androiddev/comments/6hfmoj/understanding_google_play_app_signing/

* Astronomy Picture of the Day

Also, if you don't opt out, you can get a daily notification, so you don't forget about today's APOD. :)

This is an early version, there may be a few bugs and whatnot, if there will be some interest, and I'll have enough free time, I'm sure to develop it further.

My company isn't focused on developing android app, so it is't gonna be that hard to convince them to adopt a new language, I just need a little bit more info about upsides and downsides of kotlin from people that are actually developing in Kotlin.

Edit: I forgot to mention that we have almost no experience with android using native tools and no codebase written in java.

5373,Selling apps in China — experiences of non-Chinese developers,"Hello,

We regularly receive requests to make our paid apps available in China. We have looked at Chinese App Stores to understand their policies and take steps towards listing our app, but never have taken the final step successfully.

Part of it is the language barrier. Another part, perhaps more important, is following all the policies correctly. And finally, there are over 300 different App Stores to deal with.

For those of you who have published paid apps in China, how have you done it? Are there recommended partners to work with, who can navigate these waters? (I found links online, but won't list them here because I don't have any personal experience with any of them to recommend.)

[Amazon App Store seems to work in China](http://mobile.reuters.com/article/idUSBRE94504520130506). That would be awesome, since all the documentation would be readable in English, and Amazon is known for their customer service. But what's their reach in China?

Any native Chinese speakers and residents, even if you're not developers, please tell us how we can bring our apps to you!

I found some older posts on the topic but none seem to have interesting or useful answers, so I'm posting again to solicit more recent knowledge and experiences.

5401,Why do so few Android App Developers care about letting their Users backup their Apps?,"I'm a heavy user of Root and Custom Roms and switch between Stock and laOS and other ROMS quite frequently. If I'm able to use root, everything is good with Titanium Backup, but in cases where I want to return to Stock without Root or maybe if I have a new phone or want to help a friend, the Bootloader is probably locked, so I can't simply root and backup everything (except there's once again a one-click root exploit which gets fixed in a month) because data gets deleted when I unlock the Bootloader (which is a good thing to protect your data).

But Android itself does have good backup methods already, even providing Smart Login features, which login you automatically when you open an app the first time after you installed it (Netflix and IFTTT do this, applause please, it's just really convenient!).

All of it is written down in [**this guide**](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/data/backup.html), which devs should be able to find easily (It took me a few seconds of Google search, but you should be able to also find it quite easily from the main page of the Android Developers Website), so why don't devs use this? It's just a ton of work to login to every single service again and set all your preferences how you like them, of course Root and ROM users are quite a minority, especially in 2017, but still people switch phones from time to time or maybe reset everything because they feel like they've too much stuff going on and it's draining down their battery. Also, while this maybe sound like a single big rant, I'd also just like to know reasons, if there are. I think if Google would just handle Backups as one big thing in Android, and not let every dev handle it himself, this would be in a much better state.",1500151399.0,2017-07-15 20:43:19,7.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/androiddev/comments/6htbfl/why_do_so_few_android_app_developers_care_about/

I want my app not to be noticeable, user interface wise, just intuitive.

I've also been having issues finding a transitions library that I can use with overridePendingTransistion or whatever that intent method is called, as most seem to require some custom animation object, rather than just xml files, and making my own XML files ended up weirdly (well, I copied them from an example).

5426,[DEV]Earnings and Statistics from my 2nd Android Game - Tree Tap,"Hello all, 1 month ago I had released my 2nd game on Android and WebGL. It’s a simple clicker/idle game, in which we gather funds and we buy upgrades, from time to time, we make decisions. I must say, that creating this game, was very fun.

„Tree Tap – Money Idle Clicker” Was downloaded by 539 users, WebGL version got 13500 game plays, those numbers are not big, to be honest, those statistics are really weak, but I’m glad that someone had played my game. 141 users had download game from Amazon Store, 398 from Google Play. The Biggest number of downloads (in one day) was 72. Game is downloaded 12-14x/per day. As a curiosity, record of my first game (downloads in one day) was 30. Actual number of downloads of my first game is 427.


[Statistic](http://imgur.com/a/siSjt)


How does earnings from „Tree Tap – Money Idle Clicker” looks?

$19.46 (Kongregate)

$2.37 (Unity Ads)

$0.61 (Chartboost)

I can’t withdraw those cash, it’s too small. I was ready for those earnings, I don’t hope too much on earnings, I still learn, I think, that my games are too weak, to earn some cash. For marketing, I had use: Twitter, Facebook, Reddit, Wykop(Polish website) and I had written to many youtubers, sites. I was also frequently updating game, based on players requests. As a next curiosity, my game is frequently used on those devices:

Google Nexus 6P - 4.5%

Samsung Galaxy S7 Edge - 4.5%

Samsung Galaxy S7 - 2,8%

Google Pixel XL - 2.0%

A lot of Samsung Devices ( 60-70% )

What are my plans? I plan to make new updates for „Tree Tap – Money Idle Clicker”, then I will learn new things in C# and I will make next game. I think, that it will be next clicker, but I plan to make a other mechanic for it, it won’t be boring clicking.

If You got any questions, feel free to ask them, threat this as a curiosity, I got 18 years, I’m still weak newbie.",1500154455.0,2017-07-15 21:34:15,8.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/androiddev/comments/6hzh4f/devearnings_and_statistics_from_my_2nd_android/

5443,Shouldn't Kotlin coroutines be named async/await?,"Since they let you write the implementation of async, some libraries do not default to actual coroutines.

Here is the spec:
https://github.com/Kotlin/kotlin-coroutines/blob/master/kotlin-coroutines-informal.md

Strictly speaking, a coroutine is a concept from the 70s to implement a sort of concurrence in a single-threaded processor. The most basic example is two functions calling each other at the end of their bodies.
When I heard about using this in Android I freaked out. Like why on Earth would you do this having a multi-threaded and probably multi-core smartphone.

Turns out in Android Anko is using kotlinx.coroutines under the hood, which in turns uses a job queue: the main thread. E.g.: 
https://github.com/Kotlin/kotlinx.coroutines/blob/master/ui/kotlinx-coroutines-android/src/main/kotlin/kotlinx/coroutines/experimental/android/HandlerContext.kt

Wondering if it is possible to restrict download of an app based on the users age from the developer side, rather than the user side? I know there are parental controls that parents can choose on the phones their kids are using, but is there anything that can be done on the backend to prevent download for under 13? Or does that have to occur after download, and the age restriction code lives within the app when the user is registering, and has already downloaded?",1500159282.0,2017-07-15 22:54:42,1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/androiddev/comments/6i995e/restricting_download_by_age_from_the_developer/

5470,First interview for a junior Android position coming up in a few weeks. What should I be studying?,"I'm a CS grad, 4 years out of school. Been working at a large company where their ""Development"" roles are probably closer to what you might consider an IT role. But I've been doing a lot of SQL, and more recently some simple Java (like creating POJOs).

Anyways, I've been doing some Android dev little-by-little on the side over the past 8 months or so and I have a decent understanding of the platform. I took Udacity's intermediate level course, and after that I started working on my own app. I'm also comfortable with Java since I used it all through school, but never really in a ""real life"" environment. 

I'm going to be interviewing with a small company (50ish people) they're a startup in New York that recently got bought out. I'll be interviewing for a junior Android role. I probably have ~3 weeks before my interview. I'm wondering what you would suggest I study leading up to the interview.

I just grabbed [Effective Java](https://www.amazon.com/Effective-Java-2nd-Joshua-Bloch/dp/0321356683) by Joshua Bloch and I was considering going through this chapter by chapter, taking notes, and reinforcing each with the corresponding [Fragmented Podcast](http://fragmentedpodcast.com/category/effective-java/) episode on each topic. 

It seems to me that this company is pretty ""woke"" in terms of interview styles and isn't one to go hard on the puzzle-style algorithm questions like a lot of the big-4s, but I'll probably be doing some [codewars.com](https://www.codewars.com/) questions as much as possible too. 

I do know there will be some paired-programming. Which is something I've never done before.

What else would you suggest I study? What kinds of questions do you ask candidates for junior dev roles?

5479,Using Android Studio 3's Adaptive Icon Wizard but getting no icon older devices? Fix inside!,"So, I used the new [adaptive icon](https://i.imgur.com/pBc8YwK.png) generator, and it made all pre-O Android versions display no launcher  icon.

I checked the manifest was fine, the folder structure was fine, I had ""create legacy icons"" turned on etc. [This](https://i.imgur.com/qXN3YzR.png) was my `mipmap` folder structure.

The final fix was:

* The wizard creates a `mipmap-anydpi` folder like [this](https://i.imgur.com/aQCc7dq.png), with the front and back XMLs inside.
* This folder, as it is `anydpi`, was overwriting all the density specific ones.
* Renaming `mipmap-anydpi` to `mipmap-anydpi-v26` makes the new adaptive icon only apply to O+, as desired.

Hopefully someone finds this in the future and it helps them.

5528,Is it possible to offer a company an enterprise licence for existing apps?,"I have a bunch of apps aimed at tradesmen and have been asked for pricing for a number of people within a single company. 

As far as I know there's no simple way to do this apart from:

1. Tell them to buy individual licences via Play. 
2. Suggest they share a licence by using a single Play account (not ideal for either party).
3. Sell them promo codes (unprofessional and goes against Play guidelines). 

Is there an official (i.e. via Google Play) way of doing something like this?

5531,Tip to libraries devs - exclude BuildConfig from final artifact,"I've been seeing lately a lot of `BuildConfig` files, that are generated by default and bundled with libraries. Mostly they do not hold any meaningful data, thus absolutely unnecessary. Here is small code snippet for your `build.gradle` to exclude it:

    apply plugin: 'com.android.library'
    
    afterEvaluate {
        generateReleaseBuildConfig.enabled = false
    }

There is also `generateDebugBuildConfig` task, but disabling it would give you an IDE error as Android Studio somehow expects `BuildConfig` to be present in all modules.

5535,Syncing Room database with Firebase? The current state of Android databases ...,"So, I've tried Room. It looks promising. But here's the kicker - would be great to sync between devices.

Firebase doesn't support good enough offline-first experience (at least for now). 

Realm costs 1.5k/month if you want access to your data and you must host it.

Couchbase Mobile is OK. Still, you must host and manage it. Configuring &amp; monitoring Sync Gateway etc is a major pain!

I intend to release it for $0.99. I know it's recommended to create an LLC to publish apps under but I really don't expect anyone to download it and in my state it would cost me a couple hundred for creation and an annual minimum tax of $800. So I'd essentially pay about $1000 to publish a little $0.99 app that I doubt anyone will download.

5598,Going through the Big Nerd Ranch Guide for Android third edition and its quite tough,"So I wanted to learn Adnroid programming because I had some Java experience in high school where we learned stuff till basics of object oriented programming, classes, polymorphism, constructors, encapsulation all those things. 


So I thought I could jump into android but evidently its quite tough. Should I just continue?


 My reasoning is I should get comfortable with Java first since it will make going through the book easier and faster rather than going through the book and having an incomplete understanding.

Or for example could someone explain whats going on here when we are setting up a checkbox? http://imgur.com/v6mqvzx


What is new onCheckedChangeListener and whats going on inside it?

EDIT: So its anonymous classes. It got cleared up after i read about it. 
For those who are also finding the nook difficult, I found a good place from where you can learn Java go here

5620,"Sharing my first library called ""Dusty""","Hey guys today i would like to share my first library which is called Dusty.
It's inspired by this class from the google architecture sample 

https://github.com/googlesamples/android-architecture-components/blob/master/GithubBrowserSample/app/src/main/java/com/android/example/github/util/AutoClearedValue.java

The class from the sample automatically clear's the reference in onDestroyView of the fragment.
But in my opinion it's a little bit to complicated to auto clear the values this way because you need to wrap your values.

Dusty is using annotation processing so you have to annotate the references which you want to be auto cleared when the fragment get's destroyed and then in onCreate call Dusty.register(this);.
Here is a small example.


public class SampleFragment extends Fragment {

    @Clear SQLiteOpenHelper sqLiteOpenHelper; 
    @Clear NotificationManagerCompat notificationManager;
    @Clear BaseAdapter myAdapter; 

    @Override
    public void onCreate(@Nullable Bundle savedInstanceState) {
        super.onCreate(savedInstanceState);
        Dusty.register(this); // register this fragment
    }
}

Then in onDestroyView dusty will clear all the annotated values.


I would love to see any feedback by you guys.

5648,Beginner; Making a card-deck game,"Hi
So I have recently begun exploring android and trying out some basic development stuff by going through some online tutorials. 
To keep my interest and enthusiasm from disappearing I want to make some kind of app that I would enjoy myself. 

I'm thinking about making a digital version of a simple card deck game that me and my friends play all of the time. Would you say that that kind of game is ""beginner-friendly"" to make or am I taking on too much?
I get bored doing the online tutorials forever because 99,9% of the time I have no use of what I created by following those, do you feel me?

5650,Seeking advice on making a cross platform game,"Hello everyone.

I have an idea for a cross platform game with local multiplayer that I want to work on as a side project. I've been doing Android development for around 5 years now, so I'm really familiar with the platform, but know practically nothing about iOS development, so I'm seeking advice on what the easiest way to make this work is.

As for the game, it's a pretty simple concept and can be compared to something like chess or checkers in terms of how complicated it would actually be to implement, meaning it's just going to be like a grid and some pieces to move around. This isn't the type of thing that's going to make any money lol.

If I were doing an Android app with no multiplayer I already know how I would get started.

So far I have maybe 1-3 other Java developer friends who will be in on the project, to get their foot into mobile development. I'm basically ""heading"" the project because I'm the mobile developer.

I'm planning on buying a Mac mini for the iOS side but everyone on the 'team' is a windows user and I'm hoping to not do too much work on the iOS side because working on an underpowered Mac mini doesn't seem fun.

1. I wanted to avoid using unity or similar as it's going to be a simple 2d game with, but I'm pretty certain we will have to use some sort of game engine to minimize the work of producing a client for both iOS and Android. Any suggestions on this front?

2. Are there any library's I can use for cross platform local communication? Again, it's going to be akin to chess. Each player takes a turn to move a piece. Nothing extravagant.

5667,AlcoSensing - my Android app which aims to detect if you're drunk using your phone's sensors,"Hello, I'm fairly new to Android development but for my Computer Science masters course I've developed my first real Android app called AlcoSensing. The general idea is that it gathers sensor data from users and sends a survey every few days asking about their alcohol consumption. The aim is to try and build a model which can detect if a user is drunk just from their phone usage and sensor data. Future applications could be to stop you drunk texting your ex, safety implications, etc.

Play store link: https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.joedarby.alcosensing1

Public github repo: https://github.com/joedarby/AlcoSensing

I'm using a library called SensingKit (http://sensingkit.org/) which aims to make android sensors more accessible, and I'm using ResearchStack (http://researchstack.org/) for the survey UI. 

Like I say I'm a newbie to Android and app development generally, but I'm pretty proud of my app and I think there are some cool things in there which I hope this sub will appreciate. In particular I'm using the Google Places API with geofencing to try and intelligently figure out when users are in a location where they may be drinking.

I'd really appreciate any feedback on my code or the project in general (which I've no doubt is terrible, doesn't follow correct style, etc).

If you're over 18 and in the UK then I'd especially appreciate it if you'd download the app and take part. There'll be a prize draw for 2x £20 Amazon vouchers for participants who complete the study. You need to run the app for around 4 weeks but it's very low hassle. You'll only get a very short survey to complete once every few days. Anyway thanks for reading. Happy to answer any questions and hear feedback.

5678,Stupid question: Does Android Go have anything to do with the Go Programming language?,"I know this is lazy to ask here, but it seems like all of the articles I read never mention ""how"" this version of Android uses less RAM. 


One of the reasons the name and PR release makes me suspect they rewrote the core OS in Go since it 

1. Uses less memory and which makes me think of the languages lower memory footprint from not needing a VM or JITTING. 
2. Golang is controlled by google so maybe they want to break free of the beans. 
3. It has the name go in it. 


But also maybe it's just a name like Pokemon Go or ATT&amp;T gophone.

5681,Monetization: transaction fees vs. ads?,"So I'll soon be releasing a mobile wallet for a relatively striving cryptocurrency, one for which the one and only current wallet option is a desktop one, and for which the desire for a mobile wallet has been expressed by the community multiple times. I've spent a lot of time on it and sincerely think it's high quality, and would like a monetary return on that. I'm thinking either a small fee on sending currency from the wallet (it would be difficult for me to impose one on receiving), or a small banner ad at the bottom, or both. The user would be able to pay 1 USD to remove the ads and/or fees (removal might be separate if I have both).

I don't know which would be better received by the community. I've ran it by a finance friend, and he thinks having both fees and ads would be way too greedy, and I think I agree. If I were to impose a fee, I wouldn't know what to make it. Initially I was thinking 0.5%, but my friend thinks that would still be too high. Surely there are some people here that could offer some advice on this? Even from a user point of view, I'd appreciate feedback on how you as a user would receive each form of monetization.

5687,"A major update for Android-Retainable-Tasks, my open-source library.","Since I started Android development when Android 2.0 was just released I used Android's `AsyncTask` for doing things off the UI-thread. In order to solve the rotation problem I kept active tasks in memory when a rotation changes happend (using a static `HashMap`) and simply removed the listeners in `onStop()` and re-attached a new listener in `onStart()`.

In the years that followed my methods have changed quite allot, for example instead of using static variables I have moved to the (then new) `Fragment` API to persist those tasks across configuration changes.

Eventually I decided to make my code a library, I manly did this because I saw many people use RxJava as if it could be used to solve all world problems, even though it doesn't really offer a solid solution to handle rotation changes. Yep, even with it's Android extensions, it is in my opinion still a hassle. RxJava is a wonderful product (unless you like readable code) but it's not some sort of holy grail for Android development (Note: I'm not advocating against RxJava, I personally use it!). Nevertheless, that was one of the reasons to release my code as an open-source library. To show how I handle rotation changes when working with background tasks that are in a certain way heavily bound to the UI.

Last months I've been working on a major update which includes a compile-time annotation processor which makes using the library even easier. It also has experimental support for Google's new Android Architecture Lifecycle library.

Since I have been working on this library on my own for the time being I'm quite curious what the Android community thinks of the library.

5733,"Do you use modules? If so, in what way?","With Gradle you can organize your code in modules. With recent updates to the Android Gradle plugin and Instant Apps, I have been looking into the way I'm using modules now.   
Currently, I use modules by layer, and package by feature within these modules. This way the UI module can easily find other UI components, but the persistence module has no access to any UI code.  
With Instant Apps however, it seems that you need to use modules by feature: if you have some data detail screen that you want to create into an instant app, you need to provide a 'detail screen module'.

How do you guys use modules? Do you use modules by feature? If so, how do you let the app navigate from one feature module to the other? What if you need to access some code currently another module has?",1500187460.0,2017-07-16 06:44:20,29.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/androiddev/comments/6ju2um/do_you_use_modules_if_so_in_what_way/

5735,Navigation in MVP,"So I am looking for a recommended approach to navigation in MVP.  I want to have Passive Views so I want them to be as dumb as possible. Right now I use a bit of indirection.  If you click on an item in a RecyclerView, then View calls the Presenter (https://github.com/lawloretienne/MovieHub/blob/master/app/src/main/java/com/etiennelawlor/moviehub/ui/movies/MoviesFragment.java#L184), then the Presenter calls the View (https://github.com/lawloretienne/MovieHub/blob/master/app/src/main/java/com/etiennelawlor/moviehub/ui/movies/MoviesPresenter.java#L108), then the View will call startActivity() (https://github.com/lawloretienne/MovieHub/blob/master/app/src/main/java/com/etiennelawlor/moviehub/ui/movies/MoviesFragment.java#L295).

This will give me the benefit of being able to write a unit test for the method in the Presenter (https://github.com/lawloretienne/MovieHub/blob/33fd697929148205789b09af7c5a09c205792002/app/src/test/java/com/etiennelawlor/moviehub/MoviesPresenterTest.java#L233)

I have however seen another approach to Navigation.  I think some people call it Navigator/Router/Command.  But essentially that approach will either call startActivity() from the Presenter or it will call startActivity() from a class like Navigator which is directly tied to the Presenter. (https://github.com/NikitaKozlov/MVP-Navigation/blob/59aaef5f8ca15411611711ed221b263b66996f32/app/src/main/java/org/kaerdan/mvp_navigation/core/ui/favorite_list/FavoriteListPresenter.java#L32)

Since this would move Android specific code out of the Views then it would now require you to write an instrumentation test which may be slower than a unit test and depending on the Android component could be tricky to write.

Are these the two popular approaches to navigation?  Are there other ways to do this?  What are the pros and cons of all of these approaches?",1500187732.0,2017-07-16 06:48:52,0.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/androiddev/comments/6jumtd/navigation_in_mvp/

5777,I made new Android Studio start tiles for Windows 10,"[Preview (DO NOT DOWNLOAD)](https://drive.google.com/open?id=0BxJ_3czY5niCVEg4VlhQdzJkNXM)

[Google drive link](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/0BxJ_3czY5niCTXI4QmRIVHBBWE0?usp=sharing) (there are also Atom text editor tiles)

They maintain a material Google-y appearance while falling more in line with Microsoft's start tiles.

&amp;nbsp;

**Instructions:**

1. Download the appropriate icons for your scaling level and place them in a `customIcons` folder in the directory where `studio | studio64.exe` is stored (usually `C:\Program Files\Android\Android Studio\bin\`)
2. Download the `studio64.visualElementsManifest.xml` file. If you're using a 32-bit version of Android Studio, rename the file so it is `studio.visualElementsManifest.xml`. Place the file in the directory where `studio[64].exe` is stored (Android Studio\bin).
3. Edit `visualElementsManifest.xml` and replace `scale-150` with `scale-100` or `scale-200` if needed, depending on your scaling level.
3. Find the path of the Android start menu shortcut (in the apps list):

    a. Right click the shortcut &gt; 'Open file location'
    
    b. A File Explorer window should open, go to the path bar and add ""Android Studio.lnk"", then copy the entire path.
4. Run Powershell as administrator and run this command:

        (ls ""[SUBSTITUTE PATH]"").lastwritetime = get-date
where `[SUBSTITUTE PATH]` is replaced with the path retrieved in the last step.
5. Check it out! Available in Small or Medium tiles!

EDIT: Forgot that you have to change the file name in the visual elements manifest

5783,Useful free resources for personal projects? I have a few I recommend,"I'm looking for some useful free resources for solo projects related to mobile development. I have a few I recommend as well.  
Useful categories would be:  
UX design  
Task management/BTS  
Repository/Source Control  
Icons/Logos/Fonts  
Color Themes  
The ones I recommend are:  
[**ClubHouse.io**](http://clubhouse.io) -  
This is similar to JIRA. It allows you to have deadlines, create Epics, Stories, view your burndown and velocity, block stories or create relationships between them. As a free member you can even have up to three members of a team, I thought that's pretty useful if you want to take up a project with a few coworkers or former classmates.  
I think it's good for practicing with task management too and keeping yourself on track. Building an entire Android application can be difficult as a solo developer because you don't manage yourself as easily.  
[**BitBucket**](http://www.bitbucket.org) -  
Most of you probably already know this one but I feel like one huge advantage versus GitHub is that private repositories are free for the most part. There are *SOME* limitations, but you get https/ssh for read only, you can invite team members, you can do everything you need with Git but you can do it free.  
[**Coolors**](https://coolors.co/) -  
I know Adobe has the Color Wheel tool online, but I felt like some people don't like using Adobe and the tool itself can be difficult to use. Coolors seems to generate pretty well automatically if you're having trouble thinking of a theme but know a few base colors you're working with.  
[**Origami**](http://origami.design/) -  
Yes it's made by Facebook... Yes it probably has a bunch of hidden licenses and stuff and you're probably signing away some unknown private information about your twice removed second cousin from Minnesota. But wow this is a powerful free tool for UX design.  
I barely learned about it recently and I'm fairly impressed with how many widgets and built in tools it has.  
Does anyone else have recommendations for free tools they use for mobile development?  
I'm currently looking for a good easy to use free tool for building a logo. Gimp is not very beginner friendly and I don't want to spend three months learning Gimp so I can make one logo.

Sadly the user hasn't responded to my attempts to contact him so I have no clue which tools he used. Nor do I have any clue how those scanners on Android really work.

He stated that it happened with the latest update of my app. The update only introduced a new translation and no change to the code itself. The translation is in Ukrainian so it includes a lot of unicode letters, perhaps that set it off? But it already included a russian translation which isn't that different (viewed from a naive point). 

Has that happened to anyone else here? Are there any tools out there that help to prevent this? For me it sounds like a false positive and it would be great if the developer of the virus detection tool would fix his program as it might cost me users/income.

I would like to have ads in this app to maybe make a little bit of profit from it. The issue is, I'm 17 and a half. To make an admob account I have to be 18. If I ask my parents to sign up do they become the owner of the app? Do they also need to have the developer account where the app is uploaded or can that be separate from the admod account? If my parents sign up how difficult would it be to change it after I turn 18? Should I just wait half a year so I can make my own account or is there another option to advertise without having to be 18?",1500193795.0,2017-07-16 08:29:55,1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/androiddev/comments/6k6wwp/advertise_apps_when_under_18/

5813,Advice for online courses to pursue programming,"Hi AndroidDev,

I'm a compsci uni student, just finished my first year. I'm looking to get some advice regarding what online course I should take to pursue programming.

I've had experience with Java, HTML, CSS, Javascript and Matlab my first year, but mostly Java. I'm hoping to get a programming related job start of next school year, but want to gain some more experience beforehand. So I've been looking at some online courses at Udemy.

As I've said, I've mostly had experience with Java using Eclipse, doing assignments for school and partaking in competitions. 

I'm thinking of maybe doing some Android Studio/ app development course since a substantial amount of that is Java, although I'm not sure which course would be best for me. Some of them seem to advertise ""No Programming Experience Required"" but not sure how much will be repetition of what I already had.

I would really appreciate some advice from android devs on what online courses are good.

Thanks",1500195539.0,2017-07-16 08:58:59,1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/androiddev/comments/6kagdr/advice_for_online_courses_to_pursue_programming/
5814,A user can't install my E rated app due to its rating?,"Hey /r/androiddev,

Running into what seems to be a very specific issue and my Google-fu is failing me...

I have had an app out on Google Play for over a year and a user recently contacted our customer support saying they were unable to install the app.

The user has a Verizon Galaxy S4 with Android running 5.0.1. They have reported the following:

- When they download the app from the Google Play app it appears to download but after the download completes the app cannot be found.
- The user definitely has enough available storage and they are able to install other apps via Google Play app with no issues.
- When they access Google Play from their browser they get this error:
""Your devices content rating filter is incompatible with this item""

My app is rated ""Everyone"" and according to the user there are no content filters set on their device.

Two thoughts I have:

- Does Verizon have their own content rating system on their version of Android that could be coming into play here?
- My app has one available In App purchase, maybe there is some other filter that prevents the user from downloading apps with IAPs?

I have a Verizon S4 myself which runs 4.4. I have been unable to replicate this issue. It could be a 5.0.1 issue but I can't upgrade the device because I use it to test against 4.4.

Has anyone experienced this before? Would appreciate any pointers. Thanks!",1500195602.0,2017-07-16 09:00:02,13.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/androiddev/comments/6kakzo/a_user_cant_install_my_e_rated_app_due_to_its/

5865,My new Companies Base Code is a total mess!,"Hey guys, I joined a company last week as Android Dev and let me say this: I'm damn surprised that the Project seems to be bugless!! It's frigging huge, there are more than 500 classes and the average class has 1k ~ LOC..

I have been working as a remote freelancer (android dev) for 2 years, I have been the one to get project requests, make the architecture and implement it. I have spent countless of nights on reading about MVP,MVC,MVVM, Rx,  Dagger2/Butterknife,Retrofit, and other trending Android Frameworks (I was hoping to jump on the Kotlin wagon soon).. And let me tell you that: the company uses none of the technologies I just listed! They have no software architecture, there are network class dependencies inside the View classes, the methods seem to be well named but if you look inside them then you can see they are doing so much more than they should be doing!

That company has been bought by a big global player Company and there are no other decent mobile dev companies in my town (I'm driving already 100km per day to that company). 
How shall I go on? I know it's not that easy to implement new things into a  huge legacy project, but I'm a developer and I want to become a better developer than I was when I first joined that company, not worse. They kinda treat me like a Junior (maybe because I'm new), but they asked me whether I know what Coordinator Layotu is and then gave me the task to implement a google map view into a layout and make it collapse on scrolling.. they said it'd be enough work for the next few days, I finished it within a hour and then I spent the rest of the day refactoring the activity..

5875,Communicating status and progress from background services to UI,"In multiple projects, I have had the following architecture:

* There is a local offline cache of data downloaded from the server (in SQLite, Realm, JSON files, doesn't matter).
* There is a background service for refreshing and updating the local cache.
* Usually the background sync starts in response to a timer, push message from the server, or some user action.
* Updates to the cached data trigger UI refresh (via EventBus message after completion, or Realm live queries).

So far so good. The data sync is fairly separate from the UI code - UI does not really know or care what happens in the background as long as it has consistent data available in a local database. But occasionally I would like to have a more detailed feedback about current progress from the background service to the UI.

For example, when the app first starts up with no local cache, I want to show a progress bar, display errors, and offer retry if it fails for the initial sync.

What would be some good ways to architect these messages or callbacks? To make sure that the UI can both tell the background service to ""go sync everything you can, I don't care"", and also tell the background service to ""go sync data for X, but guarantee I get a callback exactly once for the start, progress, failed and completed events""?

Ideas I've had so far:

* Make the background service post EventBus messages with status, and UI listen for these. The main issue is that when receiving the ""failed"" message, I don't know if it is response to the sync started by *my* button press, or some other earlier timer-based sync.
* Refactor the actual sync code into functions that are used both from the background service, and a AsyncTask in the UI. The main issue is that there could then be multiple syncs running in parallel (one via the service, one or more via the UI), something I would like to avoid.

Altogether, I think I'm looking for some sort of task queue, where I can add tasks, they run one at a time, and I get some sort of ""handle"" for each task that I can listen on for status.",1502058774.0,2017-08-06 22:32:54,2.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/androiddev/comments/6kse8l/communicating_status_and_progress_from_background/

5878,What are the most attractive qualities for a potential client or employer?,"Hello r/androiddev, several months ago I left my job. I was initially looking for a new full-time job, but ended up deciding to give remote freelancing a shot. I got my first client recently and things are going fine. 

&amp;nbsp;

But, I've been wondering about finding the next client, or the next employer. I'd like to keep raising my rate, getting better jobs, etc. To do that, there's no end to what I could improve on and learn. My list of things I'd like to learn grows much faster than I can get through it. There are only so many hours in a day. So I've been thinking about prioritizing what would help me increase my employability. I'm not sure what that is though, I was curious if anyone had any opinions on this topic, or seen any research about it.

&amp;nbsp;

I tend to think things like having a well known company on your resume, or having X years of experience, where X is a big number, are most important. But those aren't really things I can work on in my spare time.

&amp;nbsp;

Is learning the hottest frameworks important? 

Kotlin?

Architecture like MVP, MVVM, etc.?

Being a master of TDD, unit testing, functional testing, etc.?

Expertise in CI?

Building lots of side projects?

&amp;nbsp;

I realize it depends on the client/employer, and freelance clients are different than full-time employers, and remote is different than in-person. For example if they don't have much knowledge of Android development, they probably don't care about your expertise in Kotlin. Many employers and clients don't care about writing tests, they just want a solid product delivered on time. On the other hand, there might be a client that is only hiring if you know Kotlin. I've seen both.

&amp;nbsp;

If you spend time on self-improvement, what are you spending that time on to become the most desirable Android developer possible? Any thoughts?",1502059124.0,2017-08-06 22:38:44,3.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/androiddev/comments/6kt3pk/what_are_the_most_attractive_qualities_for_a/

As a bit of background I'm doing a project at the moment. The project requires that we create a predictive model of arrival times using historical data about bus travel in my city.

We're quite stuck for time (only around a month remaining to complete the project), and we all have no prior experience with android. I was wondering if there is a framework or 'app-builder' that would be effective at porting our web app to android?

5910,"CMV: Dagger2's 2.11 ""AndroidInjector"" is garbage and it's a bad idea to use it","Afaik the primary reason behind `AndroidInjector` is that you shouldn't need to know the component in order to inject your classes.

So instead you're provided with a magic static method that creates a subcomponent via something very reflection-like which will create the subcomponent, inject your Activity or Fragment (and nothing else is supported), then discards the subcomponent.

This essentially makes subscoping impossible, because you *cannot preserve the subscoped component across configuration change*.

Therefore, `AndroidInjector` and `ContributesAndroidInjector` are pointless, but as an added bonus it takes about 4x as much configuration than just using `Component` and `Module`.

Am I missing something, or is this really just for [somehow using the new api stuff in dagger2 and make it have more annotation config?](https://github.com/googlesamples/android-architecture-components/blob/9ba051470ec271f31dcba8cd46365fe310b7f49b/GithubBrowserSample/app/src/main/java/com/android/example/github/di/FragmentBuildersModule.java#L27)",1502062608.0,2017-08-06 23:36:48,62.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/androiddev/comments/6l049g/cmv_dagger2s_211_androidinjector_is_garbage_and/

Since I've begun developing Android, I've always used great libraries. Thought it's time to give back to the community with MultiStateToggleButton.

Android's regular ToggleButton offers only two states, MultiStateToggleButton fixes that by offering as many states depending on the number of drawable resource IDs passed in. 

A great use case would be for the flash button in a camera app, 3 states: auto/on/off.

EDIT: I found a way. For those wondering, just checkout my app's github @ https://www.github.com/Softy-Launcher
I'll be uploading the code with the tag ""ICON PACK SUPPORT""


Edit: Here's the java files you should use and how to use them:
[ThemeTools.java](https://github.com/Softy-Launcher/app/blob/master/src/main/java/com/Softy/Launcher/Classes/ThemeTools.java)

[Tools.java](https://github.com/Softy-Launcher/app/blob/master/src/main/java/com/Softy/Launcher/Classes/Tools.java)

[BubbleTextView.java](https://github.com/Softy-Launcher/app/blob/master/src/main/java/com/lb/launcher/BubbleTextView.java)

[AppsCustomizePagedView](https://github.com/Softy-Launcher/app/blob/master/src/main/java/com/lb/launcher/AppsCustomizePagedView.java)

[Workspace.java](https://github.com/Softy-Launcher/app/blob/master/src/main/java/com/lb/launcher/Workspace.java)

In BubbleTextView.java, grab applyFromShortcutInfo(ShortcutInfo info, IconCache iconCache, boolean setDefaultPadding, boolean promiseStateChanged) and replace the one existing in your BubbleTextView.java. Then grab applyFromApplicationInfo(AppInfo info), and setIconPack(AppInfo mInfo) and setIconPack(ShortcutInfo mInfo, IconCache iconCache) (code may not be the same, so just search for the method names)

Grab the entire AppsCustomizePagedView.java code, as it was barely modified. You should do the same for Workspace.java.

After copying the code, simply rebuild your project and replace any Data.** calls (they're for SharedPreferences) with your own calls. Or you can download the entire [Data.java class from here](https://github.com/Softy-Launcher/app/blob/master/src/main/java/com/Softy/Launcher/Data.java);

If you want to, git clone [this repository](https://github.com/Softy-Launcher/main), and run 'chmod a+x init.c0 &amp;&amp; ./init.c0' (if you're on windows, use PowerShell, obvi). Do that if you want to build your application off of mine. Keep in mind my main activity is in com.Softy.Launcher and it's called Mini.java.

5957,Having a problem with using Intent/onActivityResult to get a locally stored image from gallery,"**Edit: Turns out it was not working because I set the activity to ""noHistory=true"" in the manifest. Thanks /u/crowleysimon! I'll leave this up in case anyone is ever googling for a similar problem, it had me stumped for a while.**

Hey guys, I've asked about this in the Weekly Questions thread as well as on Stack Overflow but am not getting any luck, so I figured I'd make a full post to see if anyone else knows what's going on here. 

Basically I have a button in an Activity (AppCompatActivity) that, when the user presses it, opens up the user's gallery where they would then select an image. I'm using startActivityForResult and so would handle the data gotten from the gallery via onActivityResult. 

**The problem**: once a user selects an image in the gallery, the gallery closes and the app goes to the previous Activity (not the one with the ""choose image"" button, but whichever activity came before it). I have set breakpoints pretty much everywhere in the image chooser activity and from what I can tell, the intent is opening the gallery successfully, but onActivityResult is not being called at all. 

I'm basing my code off of [this accepted answer on SO](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/2169649/get-pick-an-image-from-androids-built-in-gallery-app-programmatically), as well as the same method from [this site here](http://codetheory.in/android-pick-select-image-from-gallery-with-intents/). 

My code is simple, so here it is:

    // inside of onCreate
    // you click the profile picture which should bring up the gallery
    profilePicView.setOnClickListener(new View.OnClickListener() {
            @Override
            public void onClick(View v) {
                Intent intent = new Intent();
                intent.setType(""image/*"");
                intent.setAction(Intent.ACTION_GET_CONTENT);
                startActivityForResult(intent, 1);
            }
        });

Then, 

    // this method is not being called at all
    public void onActivityResult(int requestCode, int resultCode, Intent data){
        super.onActivityResult(requestCode, resultCode, data);
        if(requestCode == 1){
            if(resultCode == 1){
                Uri selectedImageUri = data.getData();
                selectedProfilePicPath = getPath(selectedImageUri);
            }
        }
    }

Hopefully it's something obvious, and thanks for your time!

Also I'm going to create a fresh Activity and will edit in the code so you guys can try to replicate it easier. ",1502067500.0,2017-08-07 00:58:20,3.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/androiddev/comments/6l9zfs/having_a_problem_with_using/

For example, I'm using MVP architecture and I have presenters for all of my UI (which im guessing is fine), but I have quite a few similar activities that display similar UI and I feel like I am writing a lot of boilerplate. Whenever I need to show a new screen I create an activity/frag, then presenters, interface contracts..for each slightly different view. Same situation in my model layer, I have many managers/helpers and I feel like they are too linear and not very flexible to handle different models and operations. What I mean by that is that they are closely coupled with specific presenters. For example, I have managers that handle database stuff, but aren't flexible enough for different models or even other presenters.  I know you can reuse some code through static methods or extending activities/frags (is that good practice though? composition over inheritance?), but I'm curious to see what you guys do to keep your code as DRY as possible.",1502067892.0,2017-08-07 01:04:52,20.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/androiddev/comments/6larxz/how_do_you_guys_keep_your_code_drysoftware_eng/

6003,"With increase in popularity towards voice based interaction, why is it so difficult to integrate voice activation on android?","Hi, I am a mid level android developer and I have been developing this app which I think so would go from good to amazing if I could add a voice activation feature to it, before I started doing my research all I had thought was ""Ok google"" seem to be doing exactly what I am thinking of and it works pretty great on android devices starting from jelly bean so this must be quite possible and easily achievable. After a month of tinkering around and trying out different things posting questions on stackoverflow, Looking into github repos and trying to code the same logic I came to realization that voice activation seems to be a bit more painful than it should be on android devices. 

If you look at it currently you have 3 options

1. Cloud speech API - Which has a cost you on per sec usage, For voice activation you would have to continuously send audio stream and recognize it via the api and take action accordingly but continuous recognition would burn your pocket if you use this service let alone the battery consumption and bandwidth overhead

2. Speech Recognizer -  (Documentation mentions that this class is not for continuous recognition) With this you can eliminate the costing issues with cloud speech api but the battery and bandwidth consumption would still be a problem

3. PocketSpinx - This is an open source speech recognition library which would be able to recognize speech on device without internet connection. but the accuracy as I had tested and also saw it mentioned stack overflow is not up to the mark.

I am still in process of finding out the optimal solution, but I would like to know whats your take on this. Voice interactions are gaining popularity and are started to become one of major input method. 

I just felt I have to share this. If this isnt the right thread, Ill be okay if the post is take down.

Hello, I hope it's alright to ask this here. I have several family and friends that are Blind and Visually impaired.

From what I can gather currently this project outputs text to various engines that it supports. 

 Some of them would like to use Kodi on Phones and possibly on FireTV without using external speech server. What I am hoping to know, is there anyway to Interface with Talkback or is there anything that can be interfaced with to help this happen?

If so how difficult would it be? I am not a developer, However, I am considering seeing if I could hire someone to accomplish this?

So basically those operator will take a ObservableSource as a parameter. ObservableSource has only one method `subscribe`so it's a functional interface. The thing is that Observable implements this interface as well.

So if you do something like 

       Observable.just(""A"")
                   .startWith(""B"")
                   .subscribe{println(it)}

You will receive `B A` as result.

But if you replace () with {} like 

       Observable.just(""A"")
                   .startWith{""B""}
                   .subscribe{println(it)}

Kotlin will consider you pass a lambda as a parameter into that method. So the true method you calling in Java is 

    startWith( new ObservableSource{
        @Override
        public void subscribe(Observer observer) {
               ""B"";// you did literally nothing here and non of your method will get called.
        }
    })

So you break your chain in that ObservableSource. Non of onXX method will called because you have a bad implementation in ObservableSource. 
This problem I think is really common when using kotlin because we mix those () and {} really frequent.
But is really hard to find because you have nothing to trace and no error will reported neither.

Edit 2: 
Seems not only ObservableSource interface will meet this. Using method reference will face this sort of problem too.

6035,"Fetching content provider's data by using ADB *without* any permissions - contacts, events, media. I was told that it's not a security issue.","I wrote a simple [bash script](https://github.com/snatik/adb-export) that exports data from any content provider to CSV file. The interesting part as I see it, is that for some android content providers I would be blocked by lack of permissions and for other I wouldn't.  


Just an example:
Fetching data from this one, won't work: *content://sms*.
The result will be: requires android.permission.READ_SMS


This will work: *content://com.android.contacts/contacts*.
The result: **CSV file with all contacts**
Which, btw, should also check for permissions, but it doesn't. 😮


I contacted [Security Google Team](https://www.google.co.il/about/appsecurity) and was told that this is not a security issue, since user must enable developer options on the device to be able working with ADB. 


I still think that this is an issue. I guess that all members of this community have developer options enabled on their devices. So, just charge your phone in some public place, and I will be able to pull your sensitive data. I would never do this, just an example. 
Beside this, it feels inconsistent. Why SMS is different than Contacts or Events data. Block everything or nothing.


The script: https://github.com/snatik/adb-export
There is a list of all content providers that can be fetched.

Basically, I want it to be open sourced in the sense that people can audit the code (it has a financial side to it, so malicious code is a concern to the community), and contribute if they want. But I would like to retain ownership of it, or at least, as much as I can. I want my play store listing of the app to remain ""the"" listing for the app. I don't want someone else taking over or me losing control of this. I've tried figuring out the below using Google but it's all very confusing.

I've seen some open source projects still have copyright notices in the source code. Doesn't open sourcing relinquish your copyright to it?

If the code to my app is open sourced, am I unable to request that a blatant copy uploaded to the play store be taken down?

Others can make changes and redistribute the app wherever and however they want?

I've been learning Firebase for a while now, but yesterday I actually realized it's relatively easy to use my own MySQL database with some PHP mediation.

I'm quite comfortable with PHP and MySQL, unlike Firebase where I still still have to fully comprehend the new database design concepts.

Also I've been reading about how your app should not rely on someone providing you a service if you can do without it, and read a couple of scary stories regarding that.

So my question is, if I'm willing to forfeit the real-time aspect of my backend, what do I lose if I do the switch, and are there any recommended practices when one decides to do so?

6114,Mini-announcement: Servicelib now supports inter-process communication,"**[Servicelib](https://github.com/instantiator/background-service-lib)** is a library that simplifies the process of building persistent, stable Services, and helps you to access them directly from your Activities (and other Contexts).

Servicelib now supports inter-process communication. This means you can use it to communicate across app boundaries (ie. from Activity to a Service running in another app, or from Service to Service across process boundaries). Servicelib can establish a 2-way link so that you can send and receive messages between connected contexts.

Under the bonnet, Servicelib uses the Messenger class, and exposes Messages received back to you through a connection class (with accompanying listener).

6138,Open source project with a focus on testing - Updated with a ton of new stuff,"Hey everyone,


Just thought I'd share some of the progress on my open source project https://github.com/athkalia/Just-Another-Android-App

Over the last few months I've added some cool new things that you can play with:

* Added automated unlocking the screen for espresso tests, check class com.example.util.EspressoTestRunner

* Added some variations of the quick settings tiles. See https://medium.com/google-developers/quick-settings-tiles-e3c22daf93a8 for information on the feature and the com.example.features.tiles.PassiveTileServiceOnlyToggle class for the implementation (plus there are some more goodies in the same package)

* Added support for RxJavaPlugins class, that allows easy overriding of RxJava 2 schedulers in tests. See setup method of MainPresenterTest class.

* Upgraded project to use the new Mosby MVP v3 Check https://github.com/sockeqwe/mosby for more details.

* Added an RxJava scheduler that informs Espresso via a CountingIdlingResource on when to pause test execution and wait for asynchronous tasks to finish (check com.example.util.rx.RxIdlingScheduler)

* Added a basic constraint layout example (See activity_main.xml)

* Support for mocking parts of your Dagger graph via DaggerMock (https://github.com/fabioCollini/DaggerMock) library (see MainActivityTest class)

* Added Butterknife Actions (See ButterknifeActions class)

* Disabling animations before espresso tests and re-enabling them afterwards! (See grant_animation_permission.gradle and EspressoTestHelper class)

* Added chuck library for seeing network calls right on the phone. See https://github.com/jgilfelt/chuck for the library and the NetworkModule class for the added interceptor.

* Added Traceur into the project that allows for displaying more useful stacktraces with RxJava 2 (check TraceurTool class and the other related classes or https://github.com/T-Spoon/Traceur for the library).

* Added Sherlock into the project so that developers (and QA) can have easy access to exceptions occurring (and share them) through the app (see App class and the build.gradle file and https://github.com/ajitsing/Sherlock for the project).

* Gradle plugin to check APK size and automatically fail the build if the APK size is more than a specific value (check the build.gradle and gradle.properties file for the configuration and https://github.com/vanniktech/gradle-android-apk-size-plugin for the actual gradle plugin).

* Added a couple of lint rules related to colors, and to using them properly. 

* Added app shortcuts! Static, dynamic, and dynamic used via the https://github.com/MatthiasRobbers/shortbread library! For details please check bottom of App class, MainActivity @Shortcut declaration and shortcuts.xml file.

* Added support for Burst library (https://github.com/square/burst) for parametrized unit tests (see com.example.util.StringUtilsTest for more details).

* I leave the best for last. I've experimented a bit with Teamcity continuous integration server, and it's support for kotlin dsl scripts to control the CI environment. In the project '.teamcity' folder you can find my current progress, which involves 3 build configuration (1 for pull requests, 1 for nightly builds from develop and 1 for releases) that run unit tests, static analysis tools, espresso tests in firebase cloud testing, check for code duplicates, build the apks and distribute to hockeyapp, push to alpha/beta channels in google playstore, generate method count reports, apk size reports.. the list goes on! You can actually even log into the server as a guest and have a look yourselves :) You can find the link at the bottom of the github readme page of the project.


Looking forward to your feedback (and PRs!)

6145,Idea: Transform any RxObservable into a LifecycleObserver that unsubscribes on Pause,"Hola!

I'm experimenting with the new **Architecture components** from Google and I have this crazy idea:

I would love to use the observables in my viewModel directly in my Activity but mixing the best features of both Observables and Live data. These features:

- Subscribe and unsubscribe automatically on resume/pause (like LiveData)
- Stop consuming resources when unsubscribed (like Observable.fromEmitter() or the new Observable.create(), **this is not the case with LiveData**) e.g. a location Observable
- Allow more than one observer to subscribe, e.g. 2 fragments and 1 activity subscribed to the same Observable (like LiveData and BehaviorRelays)
- On second resume/subscription (e.g. after Activity rotation) immediately emit last cached value (while new subscription starts emitting)
- Allow accessing synchronously the last emitted value (like LiveData.value and BehaviorRelay.value)

At the end of today's experiment, I came with this wrapper class which I can't still decide if it's pure trash or something close to a great solution:
https://gist.github.com/sebaslogen/73a3f2707410bab4a989716513bd8ede

Then to use it from an activity I just do this:

    LiveObservable(viewModel.myLocationObservable())
      .observeWhileStarted(this, Action1 {
        showLocation(it)
      })


Do you have any suggestion or feedback if this is worth pursuing?",1502085384.0,2017-08-07 05:56:24,11.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/androiddev/comments/6ma4z8/idea_transform_any_rxobservable_into_a/
6146,Reusing UI code,"I'm having more trouble with UI code reuse than I probably should...

I have several screens that do a search and then display the output, handling any errors that might occur via Toasts / dialogs. The procedure is exactly the same in each case, though what is done with the output differs slightly.

Reusing the actual search logic is fine, I have (non-android, this is a Xamarin project) presenters that can handle that. But what do I do about the UI code that is also duplicated?

For instance code like this appears in several places across different fragments:

            try
            {
                if (networkConnected())
                {
                    showProgressDialog();
                    results = presenter.Search();
                    HandleResults(results);
                    hideProgressDialog();
                }
                else
                {
                    ShowNetworkError();
                }
            }
            catch (Exception exception)
            {
                HandleError(exception);
            }

The above would be on a fragment, `Search();` is on a cross-platform presenter, `HandleResults();` on the fragment again showing messages depending on the results or else updating the UI.

It feels like I'm missing a level of Android code that would allow me to reuse the above code (the method shown, `HandleResults();` etc) and I'm not sure what this is or how to structure it. 

I could create a base class and inherit but that sounds gross and inflexible.

Instead I think I should be creating little modules that, for instance, handle the entry and validation of search parameters. That sounds just like a presenter to me. 

The reason I'm not doing it is because I'm worried about memory leaks. Is it safe to pass a context / View reference into other classes? My understanding is this should be safe as long as the class instance is only referenced by the activity / fragment that started it such that the class can be GCed when the fragment is.

I pass context into other classes, adapters for instance, so I can't see why it would cause a problem if I do it more regularly. It's something my (equally inexperienced) colleagues have warned against however.

Who's right?

Cheers.

6151,SVG to Android Drawables Package in PNG,"Hello there,
Last year when I was making an app for my company, I was having trouble trying to import SVG directly into Android Studio. I tried Vector Drawables too but the result wasn't perfect. *Maybe this is not the case now*. So at that time, I made a small script that converts SVG into Android Drawables Package in PNG's and I used that in my project.

For all the fellow Android developers, I published the script here:

https://w3goodies.com/export-images/svg-to-android.html


**It simply works like this:**

1. You upload your SVG.

2. You provide the base size. Which becomes the ""mdpi"" version of your SVG. Let's suppose you provided 32px.

3. The page will then give you back single zip file containing these files and folders:

Folder and file | Image size
--------|--------
drawable-ldpi/your_file.png | 24px
drawable-mdpi/your_file.png | 32px *(base)*
drawable-hdpi/your_file.png | 48px 
drawable-xhdpi/your_file.png | 64px
drawable-xxhdpi/your_file.png | 96px
drawable-xxxhdpi/your_file.png | 128px

The script makes the resolution of image very high before converting so the quality of exported images will be very good.
Normally, you could directly replace the contents of zip file into your Android App ""app/src/main/**res**"" folder.

I hope this tool makes the work of my fellow Android Developers, some easy. **Happy coding!**

6182,PSA to Windows users experiencing high CPU usage with the x86 emulator after an SDK update,"Copy-pasting the relevant bits from my StackOverflow question about this issue: https://stackoverflow.com/q/45023893/1299804

This may also be the solution to [this question](https://stackoverflow.com/q/37063267/1299804), where I'm taking the liberty of sharing my findings.

On Windows 10 with the most recent release of the Android emulator (26.0.3), I notice high CPU usage **only** when running multiple instances of the emulator, and this leaves all instances after the first unusably laggy. I have tried the Marshmallow x86-64 and Nougat x86 (32-bit) instances, and have the Intel Hardware Accelerated Execution Manager (HAXM) installed.

In my case, I noticed that the emulator process (`qemu-system-i386.exe`) that was using the higher amount of CPU was surprisingly using less memory than the one that was running fine. This hinted to me that there may be an allocation issue.

I re-ran the HAXM installer (`&lt;Android SDK path&gt;\extras\intel\Hardware_Accelerated_Execution_Manager\intelhaxm-android.exe`) and selected the **Change** option to see how much memory was allocated to HAXM, the maximum amount it can use across all instances. 

It turns out it had been either set or reset (maybe the SDK update silently re-ran the HAXM installer) to only 2 GB, which is only enough to run one emulator instance comfortably (which are set to use 1536 MB of RAM by default at creation). I raised this to 8 GB (4 GB is probably sufficient for two instances but I have RAM to spare) and restarted my emulators, and now they're all running just fine.",1502089761.0,2017-08-07 07:09:21,12.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/androiddev/comments/6mj08w/psa_to_windows_users_experiencing_high_cpu_usage/

6209,A tool to help developers to debug hidden graphics energy issues in apps,"We find out that many Android apps have severe graphics energy issues, e.g. keep rendering frames of the same content due to poorly designed drawing code or animations that are not visible to users, which can blow the app’s energy drain by 2x to 10x. Furthermore, such energy bugs are hard to detect since they do not crash the app or cause abnormal behaviors, except excessive battery drain.

In light of the observations, we designed and implemented a tool called GfxDoctor (i.e. graphics doctor), to effectively detect such bugs and pinpoint the related source code, so that developers can fix the energy bugs before releasing. GfxDoctor works just like other Android debugging tools, e.g. Systrace or OpenGL ES Tracer, where users first record a trace during testing and then get a report.
The tool is currently in prototype stage and under development (hence not released yet :P).

We would like to get some feedback on the ideas. Specifically,
(1) As an app developer, are you interested in using such tool to debug your app?
(2) What features would like to see in the tool?

6210,Spoofing device OS for Microsoft Intune,"I have a OnePlus 3 and need to install Microsoft Intune to verify the device. I'd like to trick Intune into thinking my OS is a specific version so that it can pass compliance - but don't know which attribute Intune is checking to verify it. I assume it's looking for a specific key/value in the build prop. 

Is there any way for me to confirm what attribute it's checking, so I can edit that value in the build prop?

Fully realize this might mess up other apps - more just want to see what's possible. ",1502091916.0,2017-08-07 07:45:16,3.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/androiddev/comments/6mndh8/spoofing_device_os_for_microsoft_intune/

6212,Would Firebase be an appropriate database for my Citizen Science app?,"I am going to work on an app that

* Enables users to submit certain science data
* Lat-Long coordinates along with it
* Data stored on a database which will be used for different analyses.
* The users won't be reading any data, but simply sending.
* sometimes they might send some pictures too, but this can be avoided.

At its height, I expect a couple of hundred simultaneous users with an install base of a few thousand.

So, my question is, is MySQL more appropriate for me or should I go for Firebase, which I have never used before. Also, I am a beginner in Android dev, though I have experience in programming.

What would I gain/lose in either way?

6270,"How do I test, document and otherwise clean up my app?","I've been working on an app to learn some Android development and web services, and mainly it is to use for my portfolio when applying to jobs.

I want the source code to show that I am effective at documenting and testing my work, like I would have to in a real dev role.

So in terms of documentation, what's the convention for Android? In high school, we used Javadoc to document our Java code, but people seem to have differing opinions on it in the Android world. What's the standard?

Also, how do I get started with testing? Unit testing makes perfect sense to me for simple ifs, loops, or recursion, such as testing an exponent function or something like that. But how the heck do I test my method which for example changes the appearance of a specific layout item? 

I've heard about integration testing, but that doesn't make sense to me either: Sure I can test clicking here and here and looking for this text to pop up, but what if I decide to change the behaviour of my app? Seems like a ton of hardcoding to me.

You can fix it by doing:

    androidTestCompile 'com.android.support:multidex:1.0.2'
    androidTestCompile 'com.android.support:multidex-instrumentation:1.0.2'

**Original post:**

Any Googlers able to look into why the multidex library is still stuck on 1.0.1 in the public Maven repos?

The [Support Library Revisions page](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/support-library/revisions.html#25-4-0) says:

&gt; Concurrent with this support library release [version 25.4.0], we are also releasing multidex version 1.0.2. This version includes the following important changes:

&gt; * Allows multidexing of instrumentation APK.
*        Deprecates MultiDexTestRunner (AndroidJUnitRunner should be used instead).
*        Provides better protection against some bad archive extraction management of the app.
*        Fixes a bug that could lead to abandoned temporary files.
*        Provides faster installation when done in concurrent process.
*        Fixes an installation bug on API 19 and 20.

I'm not sure how to prevent adults from joining this platform and leaving inappropriate videos. A grown man leaving a nude vid on the platform would be permanently scarring to children. Any ideas how to keep adults out, and only let kids sign up?

I had an idea that in the sign-up process you could show a code on the screen and ask the use to take a vid of themselves reading out the code.

If I understand correctly from the docs :
* The derived APK has a modified AndroidManifest.xml
* There will be no modifications to the dex file(s)

Now referring to the google I/O presentation in order to minimize the APK size, it will be split based on processor architecture (x86, mips, arm ...) and based on screen sizes (xxdpi, mdpi ...).

A split based on screen sizes means also modded resources.arsc since resource table will be cleaned up which means signature modification in my case.

Android never kills activities of the foreground app, only for those in background. For me it's enough to keep just the last 3-4 detail activities, not the entire. I could think of few approaches:
1. Make the activities fragments and use replace transaction. The con is the the previous fragment must load its data from scratch and that will cause visual lag (progress bar, etc.).
2. Maintain a singleton `List&lt;WeakReference&lt;Activity&gt;&gt;` and add/remove them in `ActivityLifecycleCallbacks` and call `activity.finish()` for the first one just before calling `startActivity()` to keep limited number of started `DetailsActivity`s.

6336,"[Q&amp;A] ""How to properly test an app?"" from Test Automation &amp; Beta Testing point of views","This is an answer to post https://www.reddit.com/r/androiddev/comments/6n7xfp/how_to_properly_test_an_app/
I thought that it might be also interesting to others.

**How do you test your app?** - depends on the goals and the app. Let's split it into stages:

* prototype (you app is the only product you have) - at this stage if you don't know what you are doing, you need to make sure that your app worth building. 
If you have your prototype finished - this is going to be your alpha version. Unit tests are must, but this case (prototype stage) can be an exception. If you want to test Alpha - usually you ask friends, family or someone else to give you a feedback. Does your app help someone? Does somebody want it? Your product/idea should be tested here.

* prototype (you have running business in the background or you really know what you are doing) - Unit tests are must here. Alpha testing can go the same way. Here you can also go deeper and invite someone from your customers/community to the alpha program. You can easily setup it via Google Play Dev Console. 

* after Alpha - continue with unit tests. Think about adding Integration tests to check integration between the app and 3rd party services(or mocks)/APIs.

* beta - usually means that you have your core functionality ready and it is at least usable. 
You need to define a goal of the beta test first. Get first users onboard? Validate idea on the big crowd? Find possible bugs? Tweak UI/UX? All those can be done here. Depending on your resources, you should think about feedback collection before you start. You will get it from the Google Play or From the Google Plus community which you can also create if you want. I would suggest having one because you can use it to run surveys, polls etc.. No matter what your goal is - try to be as much specific as possible, ask about concrete feedback. 
At this stage, you will start finalising functionality and UI/UX. From the testing perspective, on the latest stages of the Beta, you can start with functional test automation.
Check ""Ice cream cone anti-pattern"" topic about that, you should always maintain something around 60%-30%-10% in your automated test distribution. 

* after beta - release another beta version! Continuous beta testing is really good thing to do. Release your app and continue doing beta releases. Done properly, it will give you a massive advantage over your competitors. 

This is a mix of Test Automation and Alpha/Beta testing strategies but I don't think that any of those should be ignored (there are exceptions ofc).


**When do you know is the right time to publish an alpha or beta version?**

Alpha: Usually a prototype. Test it with a small audience (10-50).
Beta: Minimal quality state - core functionality is there, UI/UX is usable. Maximum quality state - same as a stable version except for some peace of code (new feature/bug fix). Test it with users who participated in the beta. Do frequent updates, tell users what's new - make it a part of your development process. 


**Is better to complete the entire app functionality or release It when you have something that works?**

If you know how to make it work - do it! 
If you have any unanswered questions about your product - try to get answers first. 
It is very very hard to build something that works without showing it to others. 


**Do you know or use any service or website that can help you testing?**

I am running a TestingCatalog service which is a handpicked selection of the best android applications for beta testing with a community of 20000 beta testers behind. Feel free to write me a PM if you need help with that. 

Other services - betafamily, betabound. I can list around 50 of them but those are better. 


About me: I am doing QA automation, backend/web/mobile dev, IT operations and product for more than 5 years. More than two years ago, I decided to tackle all problems around a beta testing topic for Android and build a TestingCatalog service where I am helping Android devs and beta testers to meet each other.

6340,Are there any ad network to be avoided?,"Hey everyone!

I released a couple of apps a year ago and at first I simply used admob banners and interstitials for monetization.

Recently I moved to ad mediation by using mopub instead, with admob added as a third party network. So to get the full benefit of ad mediation, I started looking around for other ad networks to add to the mix.

I tried startapp's interstitial, but I immediately got some interstitial ads without a close button (it still allowed the user to click on the back button). And if I'm not mistaken, that breaks Google rules and can get your ad banned. And besides, I hate this behavior. Ads are intrusive enough, I don't want to make it worse.

So this got me worried, I don't want to use an ad network that would serve ads that might break Google's policy (whether by not complying to the presence of the close button, or by displaying porn ads or other forbidden stuff). I did look around a bit to try and see if there are really scummy networks out there, but I only stumbled upon a few random posts from disgruntled devs who allegedly got banned because of some ad network. Nothing really conclusive.

So, my question is: if you want to do ad mediation, how to find ad networks that you can trust? Do you just have to risk it and see how it goes?",1502103747.0,2017-08-07 11:02:27,5.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/androiddev/comments/6nb41f/are_there_any_ad_network_to_be_avoided/

6345,Advertising your app - where to spend &amp; when is it worth it?,"Hey guys,

Sorry for the very general question. I've been wondering lately if I should be investing money into advertisement to help initial growth or boost existing app downloads.

From what I've seen, depending on region, advertisement is ludicrously expensive. As an example:

----

##Health app example

* **Ad Cost** - I've seen statements listing the average cost (among advertisers) being $1-$3 USD for a *click* in the US or similar high value ad markets (Adwords &amp; Twitter ads)
* **Revenue** - ""premium"" costs $2.99 USD and about 5-10% of daily installs purchase it
* **Daily installs** - ~50
* **Geo** - 50% of installs come from the US and a large majority come from high value markets overall

---

With these numbers lets say the face value of a user is roughly $0.20. Even with the lower point of the average AND assuming every click results in an install I'm still spending 5 times more per user than what I'm earning from them.

I understand that in this case there is much more value added than simply the number of extra users I gain from this but the app is utility not a social network and the idea of a viral spike from this seems like nothing short of a Moonshot to me.

With a freemium example like this is advertising my app worth it? Are there cheaper networks I should consider/should I try targeting lower cost markets?

Any thoughts/suggestions appreciated!

6353,"Try to start Android dev with Kotlin + Anko for a beginner seems harder than Java + XML layout, surprisingly","Hi,

After many years in PC development (mainly in C/C++, Python and Go) I'm trying to learn Android Development.
I never loved Java, I have a beginner level in this language but never pass the line ""up"" because of it's too much verbosity compared to C, which I like a lot.

After the Google I/O of 2017, Kotlin came to my ears. It seems what I waited for Android for so long time. An official way to build Android apps, supported by Google, with a modern language which is not so verbose compared to Java.

So I started to learn Kotlin, the language is very polished, I can dev some CLI stuffs pretty easily in one week.

Then, I looked at how I can ""transform"" this beginner level of Kotlin to Kotlin for Android, and the problem starts here.

*ALL* documentation for Android/Kotlin begins with ""You must know Android development with Java"".
One example is about XML Layout vs. Anko. I eared someone at a conference said that if you want your Kotlin code to be even more concise, you must learn Anko directly. Anko presume that you all know about Android GUI (Activiy, Intent, Layout, Properties)...
A second example is that, when you search how to do something with Kotlin, most of the time someone throwing some lines of Kotlin, and to explain exactly what it does, throw Java lines of code as an explication (and it's true even in the Kotlin official documentation...).

My question: even if Kotlin looked to be more easy/consise for a total beginner, documentation online looked more to be focused on previously-Java-dev, so:

1) Do you have any clues that I missed to continue with Kotlin?
2) Or drop Kotlin for now and forcing me to switch to Java?

6432,Help with marketing my game - should I buy an advertisement campaign?,"I have just (yesterday) released a new action game that I made, but I am struggling to get downloads (currently at 8 installs). I was wondering what the best ways to market the game is. From my experience with my previous app, I feel as though it is impossible (for apps with few downloads) for people to stumble across my app on the play store while browsing for games seeing as how hard it is to search for (even if you search the 4 word title exactly (which no other app has) my app is still only number 16 on the list)).

I am currently thinking about making a reddit advertising campaign, but seeing as how I don't think I will be able to make much revenue on the app per install (it is a free app with no in-app purchases with interstitial ads every 3-5 minutes), I would think that it would not have a benefit greater than the cost.

Do any of you have tips for possibly cheaper options, or do you think buying advertisement would be a good investment?",1502113682.0,2017-08-07 13:48:02,1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/androiddev/comments/6nuvtt/help_with_marketing_my_game_should_i_buy_an/

There is a thread on it here: https://discuss.kotlinlang.org/t/kotlin-null-check-for-multiple-nullable-vars/1946

Where there doesn't seem to be much in the way of good solutions.

We haven't adopted Kotlin at work yet, but we are going to soon. And this is probably my biggest unanswered question for me.

Currently assigning them to immutable local vars and then checking and using those seems to be the way to go, but it's just so clunky. Feels very un-Kotlin like.

For the most part I get that we should strive for immutability where ever we can, which would get around this issue.

But for cases where we can't, especially while we're interfacing with Java code that isn't as mutable strict. How do you all manage it?",1502113702.0,2017-08-07 13:48:22,6.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/androiddev/comments/6nuxb8/null_checking_multiple_vars_in_kotlin/
6434,Can I go the html 5 route for a Tinder/9gag app?,"Hi,
I'm just wondering if I can go the html/javascript route to make a app that has the swipeable cards like Tinder, but that also pulls data from an online database, sorts it according to the value of a property and displays that in a list. I would like to use an App maker for that.

I have never made an app, but I have some experience in PHP,  mySQL, HTML, CSS and a little bit of Javascript (I mainly use jQuery for it's syntax).

What I'm considering using: 
-HTML 5 App makers like Shoutem, Swiftic etc...
-Android Studio

6468,My experience paying AndroidHeadlines to review my app.,"**What I Paid**  

I'm the developer of an Android app that wants to increase it's user base. If you're reading this you're likely in the same scenario. I paid $100 USD to AndroidHeadlines.com to review my app included with the review is a post on there website, Facebook page and Google+ page, but it is clearly labeled as ""Sponsored"" as the first word in the review title.

&amp;nbsp;

**My Experience**  

As soon as I sent the payment someone from AndroidHeadlines.com contacted me and let me know my app would be reviewed within 5 business days and that they will send the review they write prior to posting it on there site - which they did. I received the review they had written with screenshots they took, it was pretty clear that they quickly gone through my app and wrote a review as quickly as possible based on the basic functionality of the app. The review was positive and well written in terms of grammar, but they clearly hadn't used my app much since they failed to even mention some key functionality. They gave me the opportunity to request changes to the review and send it back with my for approval, I added some missing details, sent it back and all of my changes were approved and published when the review went live.

&amp;nbsp;

See the review of my app [HERE](https://www.androidheadlines.com/2016/11/sponsored-app-review-poundaweek-calorie-counter.html)

&amp;nbsp;

**The Results**  

This was my first paid app review and it was easy to see the impact it had on my installs. My goal was to get at least get 100 installs of my app, since I can get that using a Google Adwords campaign by paying between $1 - $2 per install. After 1 full day I got 377 installs as a result of the review, which works out to $0.27 per install.

&amp;nbsp;

TL:DR Paid $100 for a review of my app which amounted to 377 app installs in one day.",1502116638.0,2017-08-07 14:37:18,28.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/androiddev/comments/6o0ns8/my_experience_paying_androidheadlines_to_review/

6481,My experience paying AppFind to review my app and share it on YouTube.,"Hey All, I saw someone else post a review today and wanted to share my experience with AppFind!  If you don’t know who they are, they release video reviews for apps, hold giveaways, and more. They release a video every week and have 250k subscribers.  The price for a sponsored video is $1500, but he gave us a break since we are a start-up. After some back and forth, the price went down to $700. To keep it short, we got roughly 30 downloads on our free app.  

[Our Paid Youtube Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WW7mDzFtKk)

**My Experience**
They were *very* nice and setup was easy.  We sent some screenshots and told them some key features that we wanted highlighted. We paid them and waited.  A few days later, the video went live. The non-sponsored content was great, we couldn’t wait till our paid part.  It was okay, you could tell he was reading a script. Nothing too awful, we were happy! 

Well, okay, but lets get going on those installs, right?! 

Nah.  We got about 30 downloads in a week.  

**The Results**
 
We obviously did not like the results. To be honest, while $700 is not going to break the bank for us, it was awful knowing we could have just dumped the money into basically anything else to get better results. There is no bad blood between us, but the service is overpriced for what we got.  This was my first paid app review and it was easy to see the impact it had on my installs. 

**Recommendations** 

 I would not suggest this service to a friend!  We just overpaid for something and wanted to share our experience to save others from the headache.  

Now that we are almost out of our seed round of funding, we are looking to ramp up marketing! If anyone has a recommendation, please don't hesitate to ask!  I am searching these subreddits for some advice and just wanted to share my experience with other Devs!  Thanks


**TL:DR** Paid $700 for a review of my app which amounted to 30 app installs in one week.

6482,Android instant apps way too complicated,"Am i the only one who just doesn't understand how to properly setup an instant app.
I am currently trying to convert my app into a featured based app, but i find it all so complicated and inlogical.
Having a look at the provided google Examples i already see things i don't understand. For example:
In your installable app you import some features. why do you need to import the base as well? It is already imported in the feature module.
Then inside the base you also have to import the feature modules. I just don't get it. Its like a circular party of includes with names like implementation project, api project , feature project and application project. How can you ever understand this :). Maybe it is because i am quite frustrated by how long it takes before i can just get something to work :)

Anyway to work with Eclipse and AS?","I have a Japanese co-worker who refuses to use Android Studio, I'm joining a project with him and he already has the barebones of the app in Eclipse but he doesn't seem to be interested in migrating to Android Studio. 

He's never even tried android studio but this is a typical Japanese mindset(no offense ;) ) they hate change and oh he still uses IE6, and also refuses to use git.... that's how hard he is about change.

What are my options? is there anyway for us to work together with AS and Eclipse?
or am I out of luck and just use Eclipse? this is my last resort but I'd avoid it if I can.

Thanks!

Update 1: Thank you guys for the truthful comments, just to clarify things, some people think that the IE6 thing was a joke, it's not. He's also not a bad guy, just a programmer with really bad habits, so no I won't break his nose. I accepted the project thinking that I could change his mind but I don't think that I can do that. He's been in the company years before me, so no I can't fire him haha.

6508,MediaPlayer stops after couple of hours even with startForeground() service,"Hi. I'm working on an app with a MediaPlayer that plays .mp3 files from a server in a queue. It loads up 15 songs at a time and then adds them to the local queue. It plays them in a row, simple enough you'd think.  
But because of Android's magnificent lifecycle, the app is destroyed in the background causing the media to be cancelled. I've got a background service which is started when the main activity is started.  
The service code looks like this: https://pastebin.com/XkSueW3Q  
The service is started when the main activity is started. The MediaPlayer is controlled in a singleton class called MusicController where the initializing, preparing, caching, queue, etc. all happens. We only really call the MusicController from this activity.  
What am I doing wrong? How can I keep my music playing? I've read somewhere that the START_STICKY causes the service to re-start itself when Android decides to kill it. Does that mean I have to re-initialize my MediaPlayers when onStartCommand is called with intent==null?",1502120602.0,2017-08-07 15:43:22,2.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/androiddev/comments/6o8iz0/mediaplayer_stops_after_couple_of_hours_even_with/

6526,Is there an existing tool/project which generates kotlin data types from GraphQL schemas?,"I am brand new to GraphQL and I'm a bit skeptical to use the Apollo Android GraphQL, because it looks like the library is GraphQL first -&gt; Java types. To me it seems like a script to generate types from the hierarchy declared in the schema combined with manually wiring up everything in utility classes would be less awkward. 

I posted here because I am not experienced with it yet and would appreciate feedback from anyone that has an opinion. How would/did you go about it?

EDIT: Apollo Android seems to say that they do have a ""codegen"" tool which runs at build time, but I can only find one for Swift. 

Edit2: Apparently it's best to use the GraphQl directly and rely on something like Apollo to create the objects for you. I guess since GraphQl is it's own, turing complete langage, it'd be a matter of essentially transpiling a programming language, which I don't think most would find reasonable",1502123035.0,2017-08-07 16:23:55,0.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/androiddev/comments/6oda4b/is_there_an_existing_toolproject_which_generates/

6533,ProGuard Rules - Android Libraries,"I wrote a series of articles on dealing with proguard rules for various libraries. Please let me know if you have any feedback.

Part 1 - https://medium.com/chanse-games-developers/proguard-part-1-google-play-services-75c03de45305

Since nobody uses the whole play services library in their project. Instead they use specific sub-libraries they need for their requirement.

So my 2nd edition is focusing on Authentication library from Google Play Services. If yoj are using ""SignIn with Google"", then this might help you.

Part 2 - https://medium.com/chanse-games-developers/proguard-part-2-google-play-services-authentication-1dd340601d0a

3rd edition covers rest of other sub-libraries.

Part 3 - https://medium.com/@chansek/proguard-part-3-google-play-services-sub-libraries-ac81eed5b4be

In addition to these three, I wrote an article on Facebook's Android SDK. Here is the link:

Part 4 - https://medium.com/chanse-games-developers/proguard-part-4-facebook-57ae073a72a2


Don't forget to share it if you liked. Feedbacks are most welcome. If you feel, this series should cover a particular library, then please mention that too.

6569,Self-Taught Android Dev seeking career advice,"Hi all, I do hope this is the appropriate place to post this. Right now, I am seeking career advice. I would like to give a little bit of my history over the last two years. 

I graduated college with a degree in Computer Science in December 2014. January 2015 I began a job as a J2EE developer. They put us in training for 14 weeks. I excelled in the class and helped others. I understood OOP concepts well. However the thursday after the class ended my boss at the time had me terminated due to tardiness for some of the days I was in training. 

Two months later, a position for a work-from-home Android developer fell into my lap. I knew nothing and decided to go for it anyway. I had a week to put together a simple application and present it to the two developers that became my coworkers at the time. 

This is painful to admit, but I've slacked these last *two years*. I'm not monitored, my boss (who is hardly technical) loves me, and I've taken advantage of it. 

I could throw together an app that just makes the cut. Here at my job, my coworkers and the people that review the applications have always commended my work. However I goof off a lot and usually wait until the last minute to throw things together. 

Today I accepted a hirevue interview and tried to take it (30 seconds to think, 3 minutes to answer, recorded and shared with the company). I couldn't talk about what I need to start an app, I couldn't even answer what a widget was. 

I closed out of the window and emailed the recruiter that I was no longer interested. I knew I wanted to use it as a practice interview but I couldn't. 

What I need help with is, where do I begin? I know things... I just feel that I don't know what I know. I want to be proud of the work I do, which I feel that I am not. I want to know what I should know as an android developer. 

Constructive criticism is very welcomed, thank you. 


Edit: Thank you so much for the feedback. I feel that I have been hard on myself after reading what everyone says. When I do find a new job, I will follow up with everyone on what the words that have been shared with me here!

6571,Google Play Unauthorized Use of Copyrighted Content policy appeal,"**Background**
So a friend of mine and me run a movie review blog which obviously contains intellectual property of said movies (in our case these are images). We don't have explicit authorization for the use of these images but we believe the use of the property falls under the *fair use* section of the Copyright Act since we make it clear we do not claim ownership of these images and they are used in a transformative way as a reference for criticism. (cfr movie reviews)  


**What happened**
We just published an Android App for our blog which contains the same images as on the website. Now the problem is we got a notice that our application violates the ""Unauthorized Use of Copyrighted Content"" policy of the Play Store disallowing updates to follow through.  


**What I've already done**
I've tried appealing it twice now, claiming fair use and fully explaining why it should be fair use though the answers I've received are quite lackluster.  


**The conversation**

[After first appeal using the Play Console](http://i.imgur.com/G0lbzYV.png)  
[My reply claiming Fair Use for the 2nd time](http://i.imgur.com/n3SSQCh.png)  
[The answer from Google](http://i.imgur.com/gGd1QtO.png)  

To me it is pretty clear from this conversation that ""Jeffrey"" here does not pay attention to what the f I wrote and this definitely does not resolve the issue and I'm at a loss at this point in time.

6595,Dagger 2.11 and Android - have I missed something?,"I'm an iOS developer with 4 years experience - I have recently taken on the task of Android dev and the goal is to rework a production app's architecture. Having used the MVVM paradigm well in iOS - I naturally went this route. 

I found myself looking at Google'a Android App architectural components and that lead me to Dagger 2 - from their guide. So, I am having to learn a fair amount; Android dev as a whole and all the other stuff on top of that. 

I have come up with the following: Took an example app from raywenderlich.com and adapted it to MVVM with LiveData, Room and ViewModel. It works well. I added a repository; and then decided, to start adding DI with Dagger 2. As I said, I spent a week or so, with Dagger and DI as a whole. I have implemented this in the app and I have this feeling, I have missed something. Whilst the app works fine, I got this feeling I have not fully understood Dagger and the implementation is not ideal.  

I would really appreciate it, if someone with a little bit of time on their hands can take a look at my GitHub repository, and just look at the basic app. The Read ME  on GitHub will explain the current progress of the app and where I am with it.

6601,What common mistakes do you know of that would immediately prove on an interview that you don't know what you're doing as an Android dev?,"**Most of the info I know about this is second hand (though I did 
get some code samples as ""hey, wanna see something messed up? check THIS out"")**

**Do you know of any other super-weird things you've seen that would get you disqualified immediately?**

**A few off the list:**

--------

1.) sending an Eclipse project as the solution to the interview (instead of AS project, considering Eclipse ADT is deprecated since 2015 June)

---------

2.) using `TabActivity`

    @SupressWarnings(""deprecation"")
    public class BaseMenu extends TabActivity {
         ...
         TabHost tabHost = getTabHost();
         Intent intentProfile = new Intent(this, ProfileActivity.class);
         TabSpec tabSpecProfile = tabHost.newTabSpec(""Profile"")  
                             .setIndicator(""Profile"")
                             .setContent(intentProfile);
         tabHost.addTab(tabSpecProfile);

---------

3.) freezing the UI thread with `Thread.sleep()` to ""make sure you get the data in time"" (yes I am getting this snippet from a real ""interview solution"" lol)

    //It'd be best to wait a bit for the async task's to catch up..
    try {
        Thread.sleep(450);
    } catch (InterruptedException e) {
         // TODO Auto-generated catch block
         e.printStackTrace();
    }

------

4.) using `AsyncTask.execute()`, but then also calling `.get()` (and therefore blocking the UI thread)

    chatGet = new ChatAsyncTask().execute().get();

-----

5.) overriding `StrictMode` to allow doing network requests on the UI thread, then doing network requests on the UI thread

    //  i don't have the code sample for this one

-----

6.a) passing arguments as `static` fields (and expecting them to always be there)

6.b) storing objects as multiple `List&lt;String&gt;`s instead of a single `class`

    public class LoginScreen extends Activity {
        String[] self = new String[8];
        String user, pw, al;
        byte[] a;
        static String f;
        JSONArray regArray;
        static JSONObject loginArray;

or


	public static Hashtable&lt;String, String&gt; cids = new Hashtable&lt;&gt;();
	public static Hashtable&lt;String, String&gt; cidurls = new Hashtable&lt;&gt;();


-----

7.) storing `static` reference or member variable in a singleton to the `Activity` 

    public static Activity aProfile = null;
    public static Activity aChat = null;

------

8.) despite using Kotlin, constantly yelling at your compiler

        val email = mUserNameView!!.text.toString()
        val password = mPasswordView!!.text.toString()
        //...
        if (!result!!.startsWith(""error:"")) {",1502129607.0,2017-08-07 18:13:27,50.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/androiddev/comments/6oq7m5/what_common_mistakes_do_you_know_of_that_would/

I never finished the class because it was mostly videos. I felt like watching videos and reading wouldn't help me better than just starting what I wanted to work on. This method helped me with python but for Java it feels like I'm not learning anything.

99% of time, coding is me literally copy and pasting code/templates and then trying to make it work for my app. Pretty much I'm following [this](https://i.imgur.com/wOsEq7N.png) to a tee.

6609,Android WebService vs WebView. Why shouldn't I use a webview?,"I'm working on a project for one of our larger clients. The code I was given is rough at best. I'm working through this, but the flow of the data is basically a super complicated webview. We're sending Get requests to a proxy server running the api. This server returns data and then I inflate the views as necessary to show the data. 

The api is running on a server that is also running the website. The website is working great on mobile. 

When I was given the project I was told that we are basically using webviews for the time being. These get calls aren't exactly web views, but I could see how they could misconstrue that. 

My question is this... Let's setup an example so I can better explain it first. 

Web Service: User opens the app to a login/register page. User enters their info and hits submit. The app sends a Post to the server entering this information and checking if it's valid. If the info is valid we move to the next activity. The next activity sends a get request to the server and when the data is returned, it builds a list of the items (products available). 

Web View: User opens the app and the website login/register page is shown. User enters info and it is validated on the site. After logging in, the user is taken to the dashboard, or product list as described in the above example. 

Is there any reason for us to be going through all this trouble to display the same information from the same place? I'm not trying to get out of work. I'm paid by the hour, so it doesn't really matter to me, but is there any potential benefits to creating a native app built on get requests vs using webviews that are nearly identical to what I'm making?

AdMob impressions (and revenue) has fallen to almost zero for one of my apps and I have no clue why. The only change that I could corelate this to is that I changed Ad unit name in AdMob user panel but have checked that Ad Unit ID stayed the same.
I checked in Google Play Console and number of active installs and new installs are average, no drops.

How can I check what is happening further?",1502131682.0,2017-08-07 18:48:02,12.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/androiddev/comments/6oucjm/sudden_drop_in_admob_banner_impressions_90/

6625,MediaRouter into Fire TV Stick Mirror or at least into an app.,"I am trying to mirror cast using my own app into a Fire TV Stick that is connected to the televsion.
It has an option to Mirror the display.
My phone can connect to the Fire TV Stick this way, but I would like to mirror something with a smaller resolution and even if I change my phone's resolution using adb, I think it sends the native resolution anyway.

I looked into MediaRouter and MediaRouteProvider. Also downloaded the Media Router sample that it's snippets are used in the documentation.
The sample ran but didn't work.
And this API is super complex and have so many things in it. I am not sure how to build a simple app that cast video(and later phone's screen) into another device, either the Amazon Fire TV stick mirror display or at least into a client app I will also write.

I couldn't find compact enough samples to do what I want.

I started programming for android some time ago and a friend who's a programmer (not android) suggested it would be a good thing to read some things about design patterns. Now I wanted to have a look if there are some relevant resources for design patterns used in android, but the only thing I found was https://www.raywenderlich.com/109843/common-design-patterns-for-android which is from 2015 (some resources I found are much older).

Is this still relevant/complete or have some patterns been added or removed from this list?

6730,[Malware] We found Malware impersonating our App on Aptoide,"For anyone who doesn't know Aptoide is a 3rd party Appstore mainly used for distribution of paid apps for free (copyright infringement)

It is a pretty shady operation and their app has been banned from the Play Store. They operate from Portugal and are fairly slow to respond to takedown requests. Their CEO is Paulo Trezentos, who does not seem very concerned that the main business operation of their store is to offer paid apps for free. 

They can easily verify if an app is actually a paid app on the Play Store by running the package name against the uploaded package name and check if it is paid or not - there is no possible excuse for what they do!

Today we found out that one of our paid apps was being distributed there and was downloaded at least 14,000 times which is a potential loss of roughly 40,000 USD for us. 

But that is not the reason for this post. The biggest problem is that we found another app, which is using our name and app icon, under a different package name and is potentially a Malware or a Spyware. We are investigating the file on hand, but so far we can't really say what is going on behind the scenes.

The app uses a lot of permissions, but these are mainly Badge permissions to display Badge Icons over the App Icon.
The main concerning permissions are:


android.permission.INTERNET

android.permission.WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE

android.permission.READ_EXTERNAL_STORAGE

android.permission.INSTALL_PACKAGES

android.permission.DELETE_PACKAGES

net.baned.yandex.thailand.permission.C2D_MESSAGE""   

com.google.android.c2dm.permission.RECEIVE

android.permission.WAKE_LOCK

android.permission.RECEIVE_BOOT_COMPLETED



What we found out so far (it is after hours now)

1) The app has an images.jpg file in the raw directory which we are not quite sure if it contains malware, it seems like a hidden zip file - the Virus checker returned no results, but that does not mean anything.

2) The app downloads and extracts the images.jpg, which is a hidden zip file  from /raw/ to the download folder on the phone in a file called PICTERES_ZIP 

3) Then proceeds to extract it. The hidden zip file is password protected, from what we can tell.

4) Then they create a new file called playmarketupdate.apk from the contents of the zip and open it immediately/startActivity on the object.

5) ?

We are not quite sure what happens next.

There is a bunch of Base64.decode code, which does not throw anything, maybe the zip pass is somewhere in there. 
Maybe someone can help us out and maybe we can report this file or at least figure out what they are trying to do?

We are pretty sure they use it with a lot of other APKs and the chances are Aptoide is infected with these types of APKs.

We are including the APK for you guys to unpack and help us out!

Here is the APK file

It also needs to record and store typed responses/inputs from the user.
 
I have a very limited amount of time to get this up and running, so what is an efficient way to do this? I have 0 experience with app development of any kind (and only experience with programming in Matlab, Python &amp; R). I've gone through some of the basic tutorials on the android developers website using java, xml etc.. but I've also read about things like fabric.io, kotlin, telerik, etc..
Could anyone offer any advice on what path I should take to get this app ready for my research?

6771,RealmList + JSON = difficult. Regalia makes it easier,"Hey there,

Lots of times, it is hard to get a JSON parsing library or Parceler library, such as Gson, Moshi, parceler, etc working with Realm due to RealmList. These libraries have no knowledge of Realm and therefore do not know what to do when they encounter it. 
  
For this, we have created [Regalia](https://github.com/Commit451/Regalia), a collection of artifacts meant to ease the integration of RealmList and Realm in general with other libraries. So far, support for RealmList is included for the following libraries:  
  
- gson  
- LoganSquare  
- Moshi  
- parceler  
  
It can be complicated to integrate properly with these libraries, so we hope these artifacts or the direct source will help others integrate Realm easily.

6774,"Is returning Pair&lt;Object, Error&gt; instead of Nullable Object idiomatic?","So I've been into Golang lately and in Go they use an idiom that every method that could generate an error returns an error type in conjunction with any other return type.

Meaning that your typical CRUD would look something like this:

    interface DAO {
    
        fun getTasks(): (List&lt;Task&gt;?, Error?)
        fun saveTask(task: Task): Error?
        fun updateTask(task: Task): Error?
        fun deleteTask(task: Task): Error?
    
    }

Which when used produces something like this:

    val (res, err) = SomeDAO.getTasks()
    err?.let { // handle error }
    res?.let { // handle success }

In Java the most popular way I've seen distinguish these 2 states(succeeding or failing) is to take in a Callback interface parameter and call *onSuccess()* or *onFailure()*.

Or even return a Nullable type, where **null represents a failure**.


Although we [can't have multiple returns in java](https://discuss.kotlinlang.org/t/multiple-return-types-from-function/664/2), we could make something like this:

    data class Response&lt;out R, out E&gt;(val success: R?, val error: E?)

    interface DAO {
    
        fun getTasks(): Response(List&lt;Task&gt;?, Error?)
        fun saveTask(task: Task): Error?
        fun updateTask(task: Task): Error?
        fun deleteTask(task: Task): Error?
    
    }

Back in November, something changed with Google Wallet; I could no longer send money via Wallet because of my linked Dev account (it gave an error something along the lines of: ""You can't send money with your merchant account"").

&amp;nbsp;

Well, fast forward to a month ago, and now Wallet has ""profiles"": Personal and Business. I can use Wallet again after selecting the default profile to be my ""Personal"" one. Unfortunately, now I can't use my Google Play Store credit I have accumulated--because it's tied to my ""Business"" profile. Furthermore, I have $10 in my ""Business"" profile's Wallet Balance that I can't cash out since Wallet won't allow me to interact with my Business profile at all.

As a first step in a research meant to improve collaboration between designers and dev, I have created a 2 mins survey for developers who work with designers on an daily basis. Please take a couple of minutes to fill the survey, and share it with as many developers as you can.

This project is very important for me, and I'm sure it will help the two groups to work better together.

I have a high uninstall rate. Almost 75% of the users have uninstalled the game already. Maybe I was wrong with releasing early?

On the other hand I have learned from the sparse feedback that I need a tutorial or at least a help page or something. But I hadn't put this as highest prio without the feedback. So maybe it was good to release early.

What do you think? What is your experience with releasing android games early?

6899,"Sick of webdev, thinking about becoming an Android dev","I found Udacity's nanodegree & Google's Android cert eights month ago and I've been thinking about becoming an Android dev since then, I think I could finish them in a few months since I can learn all day long and have programming background. 

One thing I've been worrying about is would I like it? What I hate most about webdev is the every day changing new favorite frameworks, tools, libraries etc crap. Also web feels like a dying platform, over 80% of visitors on my sites are on mobile, why even bother making a PC version of the site? It doesn't feel like a real skilled job, every fool with a macbook is nowadays a front end developer. 

So what I've read Android is a little more stable platform, no new framework every week and I could do some ""real"" programming. 

Some other pros I can think of right now are:
1. Good potential for own start up, new apps providing services are popping up like mushrooms after a rain and they seem to be easier to get huge than some random website. Who says ""go check x.com"" to a friend instead of ""download this cool app?"" Nobody. 
2. Job security and higher salary, Android being a specialised field is better than webdev with its billion Starbucks-macbook-3-week-bootcamp devs.

Well I don't remember what my question was when I started to write this. Maybe some of you have some thoughts and maybe here is somebody who did a similar career change and can tell about their experiences.

6933,What is null here and how can I repeat it?,"Hi All,

I am getting a null pointer exception on this piece of code below from some of my users. I am trying to reproduce it but I cannot for the life of me make it happen.

The code is the following:

    @Override
    public void onConnected(Bundle connectionHint) {


        SupportMapFragment mapFragment = (SupportMapFragment) this.getChildFragmentManager()
        .findFragmentById(R.id.map);
        mapFragment.getMapAsync(this); /// Null pointer is here.

        getDeviceLocation();
    }

The null pointer is happening on this line mapFragment.getMapAsync(this); I believe you cannot have ""this"" as null so it is most likely mapFragment that is null? 

Could anyone think of a reason to why this might be null or how I could repeat it, I am guessing it is something to do with attaching / detaching of my fragment possibly?

6940,Managing multiple project modules,"I am currently working on a project where I will be creating 2-3 libraries which will contain codebase that, in the future, will be shared with other projects. Since these libraries cannot be tightly coupled, each library is its own project. While modules can be imported from different projects using Gradle, this approach is not ideal, since each team member would have to have the same directory structure for the projects.

Becuase of this, I'm struggling to find the ideal way to manage these dependencies. My first attempt was to use a private Maven repository, where each library is compiled to an .aar and uploaded to the repository. Any project that makes use of this library will then update to the new version to get the updated library. The main issue with this system is that every time a change needs to be made to a library, however small it is, a new release of the library needs to be made, which can be rather time consuming.

My second approach was to add git submodules for each library to the project which makes use of the library. This is much more convenient that the first approach, since the submodules can track the latest changes to the branches in the library's git repository and simply pull the latest changes, removing the necessity of a binary release. In some small tests that I have made, this approach works well, however I have read several sources claiming that git submodules are rather problematic. 

Finally, I have also considered using Jitpack, however the organisation that I am working with is not comfortable with giving full access of the codebase to a third party, and personally I would also prefer to not depend on a third party service. 

I would really appreciate it if anyone has any suggestions on how to manage such a system and which, if any, of the approaches that I am following would be ideal. Any new methods would also be great.

But here’s the catch: currently the demos that I found that shows how to implement the Retrofit/OkHttp module has a static base URL, which doesn’t work for me since that information is available until the User provide it on the Login section…

Digging around I found that one solution is to create a Submodule with a given Scope Instantiate the component inside my Activity/Fragment. But because I’m using Android Dagger to perform the injection, I have no idea how to do so…

Is there an example that I can look around, or should I give up on this path and take the OkHttp interceptor to change the URL?

6953,How do you _legitimately_ use LGPL libraries with Android without infringing copyright?,"Hi.

I'm wondering about this. I have got a situation where I need to use some LGPL licensed open source libraries with an Android program I was making and am wondering specifically how you can distribute it _legitimately_. I also don't mind if the program itself has to be released under LGPL. But I do want this to be honest.

The question though is _how_ exactly do you comply with the various LGPL requirements? It's not at all clear given all the weird and seemingly very restricted/incongruous-to-LGPL-and-Free/Libre-software workings of the Android app distribution and development system. I'm also looking to post the app through Google Play. How do you affix source code? I don't suppose you can somehow stick it into the .APK. Would linking to a copy on a file hosting site in the app description appease the LGPL? Ditto for the library source code. What _exactly_ must the appropriate gimmicks (disclaimers, etc.) contain, i.e. with an explicit example would be ideal, and _where_ should they be included? What about static vs. dynamic linking? How do you ensure the right version of the source code for the library is included with the package when you're using an automatic gradle download in the Android Studio? Also, I've heard there can be difficulties regarding LGPL and signing. Is it kosher to give away your - or probably, a specialty-made for this purpose - private signing key to end users so they can sign new copies to comply with the LGPL relinking requirements or is this illegal (perhaps more illegal than violating copyright?! e.g. criminal offense like fraud/misrepresentation/impersonation or something?!)? And I need answers to _ALL_ these questions - any one missing could be a potential LGPL/copyright violation, if not worse.

I have found very little _good_ information that actually seems to specify this, and Google searches for it give very sparse results. I have also found some very interesting statistics that show (L)GPL piracy is rampant and extreme - and I also wonder if that is why (and perhaps also might not be contributed to by in at least some small way) there is this dearth of good information. Because few - too few - people bother to want to respect the terms or get alternative permissions and so just rip stuff off. So too few ask about it.

I started coding last summer at a General Assembly bootcamp; somewhere in there I started lurking here daily and drinking the Rx/MVP/Dagger koolaid. Maybe that should be a capital 'K' because recently it's been Kotlin, too

Anyway, I wanted an app in my portfolio to show potential employers. My goal is to become a professional android developer, so I've been trying to implement all the stuff I've read on this subreddit. I was hoping you fine folk could have a look at the source code and critique the hell out of me.


 


Here's the link to my GitHub page with the source code:

https://github.com/jord-goldberg/ExTessera


 


I'm afraid I've made some sort of bastard child of multiple architectures. Is that a bad thing?  The summary on the GitHub should give a bit of instruction for looking through the code.


 


P.S. - The feedback I've gotten from the intended audience so far has been positive and hugely constructive. I made a post on r/dndnext yesterday; it was a great experience and in 24 hours I've gotten 100+ downloads. Here's the thread if you want to take a look:

I've have recently (for about 6mos) begun working as a freelance Android Developer. Luckily, I've had some traction, and a few major projects. I do, however, struggle to establish a fair hourly rate. I was not able to find many satisfying threads on the subject in this subreddit, nor with a few Google searches. Therefore, I would like to ask you guys the following: **what hourly rate do you charge, and how did you arrive at this number?** 

I realise the answer to this question relies heavily on **locality, experience, and education**.  Therefore, including this in your answer would help loads! I myself, for instance, live in The Netherlands, which undoubtedly has far lower salaries than devs living in the Bay Area.

Thanks in advance guys!

The list goes on, but no matter how hard you try, there is always going to be a point when you just can't add more code. Because the more code you have the harder it is to add even more.

I am not talking about clean-code guidelines, that is too local.

I have tried a lot of approaches, my latest one is putting my program into reusable modules and having only the minimal application-specific code that is necessary. The problem is that not all functionalities can be divided so easily and I ended up the same.

i am new to android development and programming in general. Since i also have to learn java, i am a bit overwhelmed by all the android guidelines.

I will probably not release anything soon, but i want to know anyways:

Do i have to adhere to their design guidelines? For example do i have to use their bottom navigation bar with the little images? Or can i make my own?

If the guidelines are just a suggestion, who will check if my app design looks like crap?
And will they check if my app is buggy or uses uncessery ressources? Or is the penalty ""only"" bad playstore ratings?",1502316127.0,2017-08-09 22:02:07,0.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/androiddev/comments/6s1w53/are_android_design_guidelines_mandatory/

7042,What's the best overall strategy for debouncing clicks?,"In Android, OnClickListeners are not run as soon as a click is detected. Instead, they are added to the message queue via `View.post`.

This causes problems such as the following:

Imagine a simple Activity with two buttons. When the first button is clicked, the message ""1"" shows and the second button is disabled. When the second button is clicked (assuming it wasn't already disabled), the message ""2"" shows.

Now, an unknowing person would think that it would be impossible to see ""1"" followed by ""2"", but it is indeed possible, as long as the user clicks the second button very quickly after clicking the first button.

For more info, see https://issuetracker.google.com/issues/36933127 .

People have created solutions for this problem. [Here](https://github.com/JakeWharton/butterknife/blob/master/butterknife/src/main/java/butterknife/internal/DebouncingOnClickListener.java) is a good one from Butter Knife. However, this approach is very limited, as it works only in situations where we get to define all the OnClickListeners. It doesn't work with Toolbar buttons, for example.

How do you guys deal with this issue, in general?

So far, in my app, my strategy is to just ignore it unless it would be really bad in some particular case, whereupon the Activity (or something else) uses conditional statements to avoid the bad behaviour. But it's not ideal, as allowing the multiple clicks makes the UI look unprofessional (e.g., two screens are opened at the same time when this shouldn't be allowed), while preventing multiple clicks either is impossible or increases code complexity.

Note that plenty of Google apps show this bad behaviour. An example is the Gmail app -- try pressing the hamburger button (at the top left) and the Search icon (at the top right) at the same time. You can make the navigation drawer appear at the same time as the search UI (along with the software keyboard).

I think the only solution is to allow multiple clicks in general, as this is ultimately a framework issue, but I'm curious of what others do here.",1502316444.0,2017-08-09 22:07:24,51.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/androiddev/comments/6s2j9s/whats_the_best_overall_strategy_for_debouncing/

7052,Distributing and updating app on single purpose device,"I hope this is a relevant post here.
So, we have developed an android app for single purpose devices that are installed in medical facilities (I hope its okay if I don't share a lot of details about the exact functionality of the app and the H/W). The initial version of the app is not registered on the PlayStore, and the apk is installed on each device manually. We are currently trying to come up with ways to manage the distribution of the app on the devices, and so that we can push the updates without having to go around with an SD card from facility to facility. Currently its only installed in abound 50 devices, but this number is expected to explode to hundreds, and thousands in the future, once we complete the full-feature development. We have been looking at many third party solutions like MobileIron, AirWatch, GenyMotion, but they all seem like overkill for this. Another option was to get a G-suite plan, and use their EMM features, but we are not sure how effective that would be either. 
We also thought about creating Google accounts on the devices, signing into the play store with them, registering the app on the PlayStore in the alpha/beta phase, and adding the created users to that tester program...but that seems like a nightmare to manage especially once the total number of users go beyond ~100 of something. 
I feel like that there may be a simpler solution to this that we are not able to see. Any suggestions? btw the update request can be user initiated as well.
cheers!

I am implementing a sports tracker for myself and it can pull of the basic things (it can track all info of me running, list previous runs). Now i want to make this social that you can follow other people and share past runs with them (like Strava). Two questions about this:

1) What is the most efficient way to setup the communication between users - how does this dataflow go ? I guess it is the best strategy to have 'one' central server that all the app users communicate too.  What are the best practices to communicate between an app and a server ? (transfer an sql db I guess) ?

2) Currently I log every timestep of my run directly in the file, since I/O typically is bad performance wise I assume on Android too. However what would be best practice here ? I guess a database but am worried that the db is lost if the app crashes. correct worry ?

7073,Parameter naming conventions.,"I'm from an iOS / Objective C background and recently started working on an Android project within my company. 

A couple of the first things I noticed when looking at the code base were the naming conventions used in field / member names and parameter names on methods / functions. 

Field / member variable names are always prefixed with an ""m"" 

Example: private String mUsername; 

The 'm' standing for 'member' I kind of get this and am told it makes reading the code easier. Personaly I think 'this.username' would work better. 

Then there are the parameter name conventions that I just cannot get past. 

They are always prefixed with 'a' - this seems redundant and unnecessary to me. 

Example:.  
Public void doSomething(List<Strings> aStrings){}

What's the point of prefixing the List parameter with an 'a' ? 

I don't see this in any other codebase except for the one I am working on. I have asked the authors of the codebase and they simply say they do it because the API guys do it in our Java codebase. 

I'll be asking them next week. But for now would like any thoughts on the above conventions. ",1502216436.0,2017-08-08 18:20:36,1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/androiddev/comments/6s7w8z/parameter_naming_conventions/

I am currently developing a 2d platform game and have some questions in regards to tools; I want to make the sprites animated for walking forwards and backwards and was wondering what tools other developers would suggest.

Alot of developers are using Blender for thier animations, although this is typically for 3d animations. At the moment I'm betting that the best solution would be to use Unity in conjuntion with Blender 2D. Does anyone have any better suggestions for this project?

I have been quite surprised when I discovered that Realm doesn't support Kotlin's data classes and switching between threads with RxJava (with instance open with Realm.getDefaultInstance() and than subscibeOn(Schedulers.io()).

Realm is really pleasant to use, but do you choose it as your DB despite those drawbacks? 
If so do you use some extension functions to make it usable?
And for most: what is your choice for DB in new projects? 

Edit: One more drawback for me (in context of Kotlin) is that Realm demands empty constructor, we have to provide default values for all fields - goodbye null safety.",1502347479.0,2017-08-10 06:44:39,0.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/androiddev/comments/6sk34b/discussion_is_realm_still_alive/

We've botched a couple of releases because of this refresh mixed with timed publishing and now I'm really starting to think the app releases section should be updated to be more clear.

This is the current scenario I'm in.

1. Turn on timed publishing
2. Create a production release.
3. Hit the scary ""Start rollout to production"" button
4. Wait a few hours, and actually realize that the rollout button doesn't actually rollout, because you wanted a timed release
5. We found a last minute issue that we need to halt the release. No easy way to do this apparently?
6. We want to make sure the issue doesn't appear, so we add a new build in beta stage.
7. Hit ""start rollout"" button again. Not sure if anything happened since I'm on timed publishing
8. Now we have 1 broken release in production we DO NOT want to release, and a fix in beta that WE DO want to release, but there's only a single GO LIVE button. What does GO LIVE do? Does it push my broken production release into the wild AND the fixed beta? Or does it only do one of them? Or is timed publishing not affect betas?

I have a question, how should I return a bitmap (image) from the repository/usecase ? From what I understood those classes shouldn't have any android dependencies for testing.

So how I'm am supposed to return the the image back to the presenter (which shouldn't have an android dep either) so that it can set it on the view?

My only idea currently is to return a kind of key, and have the view directly access the memory cache and use that key to retrieve the bitmap, but it feels a bit weird.

Moreover, how is the presenter supposed to check the memory cache before downloading ?

7157,Enable/disable features based on backend config - best approach?,"Imagine I have web system for managing employees, projects and devices inside a company. 
Android application is talking with the server through REST API and has the same functionality as web portal.

Let's say that the system has 3 plans:

* *Tier Free* - manage only employees
* *Tier Plus* - manage employees and projects
* *Tier Premium* - manage employees, projects and devices

Clients can change their plans only through web portal, they simply check/uncheck which features they want to pay for.

Server provides an endpoint which returns list of enabled modules, eg.:

    {
        employess: true,
        projects: true,
        devices: false
    }

Based on this configuration I need to hide/disable some parts of the Android app. What would be the best approach here? The only idea that I have is to simply make a call on this endpoint every time app is launched and store this configuration JSON in memory/shared preferences. Based on this I can show/hide something by *if elsing* it or by injecting configuration specific presenters. There might be couple of problems with that:

1.  User had the app in background and during this time he changed the configuration. Once he go back to the app old configuration will still remain. 
2.  Users with rooted devices can edit shared preferences and this means they could potentially edit the configuration JSON. Of course backend is validating if user can access eg. `/projects/*` and does not allow to use some features if they are not enabled in database.


Any idea how to make it more bulletproof and robust?",1502427148.0,2017-08-11 04:52:28,4.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/androiddev/comments/6srgzb/enabledisable_features_based_on_backend_config/

7160,Gradle: Ensure your Google Support Libraries are at the same version,"Google recommends that all the Support Libraries you use in your app be at the same version. This is specified in your `build.gradle` file. Android Studio even offers a way to check for updates and individually upgrade the versions of each support library when viewing the build.gradle file for your module.

Here’s a trivial Gradle tip to ensure you never have to worry about this: define your supportLibraryVersion as a constant, and use it in all your compile dependencies. When a new version is released, change it in one place and re-sync your project.


    def supportLibraryVersion = ‘26.0.1’

    dependencies {
      compile “com.android.support:appcompat-v7:${supportLibraryVersion}”
      compile “com.android.support:cardview-v7:${supportLibraryVersion}”
      compile “com.android.support:design:${supportLibraryVersion}”
      compile “com.android.support:palette-v7:${supportLibraryVersion}”

7187,Android's UI framework needs fixing (a follow-up to my post about click debouncing),"Hi all,

I posted [the other day](https://www.reddit.com/r/androiddev/comments/6s2j9s/whats_the_best_overall_strategy_for_debouncing/) asking about a good strategy for handling click debouncing. For the past few days, I've been thinking about the replies I got, thinking more about the general problem, reading framework source, and trying many things. I have come to the conclusion that there is a big problem with Android's UI framework.

I'm not going to assume that you've read that post, so here is the gist: There are two major sources of asynchronicity in android.view.View:

1. OnClickListeners are not run immediately.
2. View.requestLayout does not complete immediately.

Each of these makes sense. However, when they are combined, it's difficult or impossible to write apps without bugs.

Consider a simple app with a button on top and list underneath. It doesn't matter whether the list is a ListView or a RecyclerView or even a custom solution.

If the user clicks the button, the last item in the list disappears. If the user clicks the last item in the list (assuming it hasn't already disappeared), the message ""You clicked item 5 with caption 'Foo'"" shows.

Now, this app is immediately very buggy, and clicking the button and then clicking the last item very quickly will produce unintended behaviour (perhaps a crash). Here is why:

1. The button is clicked.
2. The button's OnClickListener is posted to the message queue.
3. The list item is clicked.
4. The list item's OnClickListener is posted to the message queue.
5. The button's OnClickListener (see #2) is run. This asks the list to remove its final item.
6. The list calls View.requestLayout on itself, because it has been asked to change.
7. This layout request is posted to the message queue.
8. The list item's OnClickListener (see #4) is run. This assumes that the list hasn't removed its final item and crashes (perhaps with an IndexOutOfBoundsException after reading from an ArrayList defined by the app).
9. Not executed: The list's layout pass (see #7) would have run now, but the app has already crashed.

In response to my last post, a couple of people talked about using a state machine or Boolean flag to avoid this, but I don't think that works.

Imagine if we set a `listIsUpdating` flag and checked this before doing anything in the list item's OnClickListener. This would be insufficient, as it's possible for a list item's OnClickListener to run after the list has finally updated (#9 above) and therefore `listIsUpdating` is false and the payload will run anyway. This is possible because the list item's OnClickListener runs asynchronously (in other words, even though the user clicks while `listIsUpdating` is true, by the time the OnClickListener actually runs, `listIsUpdating` may be false, and then we have a crash).

If I'm right, this system badly needs fixing. I've been doing Android development for over six years and I've read the framework code over and over, and even I am bitten by crashes in my app relating to OnClickListener and View.requestLayout being asynchronous. What hope does a beginner have? In fact, I'd go so far as to predict that almost every single app that allows clicking and has a list (of any kind) has bugs like this -- even apps written by the best Android programmers that exist.

Are there any Googlers who can respond to this. Surely I'm right, right? There's no easy way of dealing with the complexity of both of these methods being asynchronous. It seems to me that this must be fixed on the framework side.

Somebody filed a bug on this and it got auto-closed a few years ago. I couldn't find any others. Hence I am posting on Reddit in the hopes that somebody read this and fix the problem -- or prove that I'm wrong, but to be honest I doubt it. I've done so much testing here that I think I have proof that everything written in this post is correct.",1502470276.0,2017-08-11 16:51:16,35.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/androiddev/comments/6suxdq/androids_ui_framework_needs_fixing_a_followup_to/

Now of course I want to pass these features down to my users, but I'm kind of confused on where to create the channels. 

The docs also mention this

> Attempting to create an existing notification channel with its original values performs no operation, so it's safe to perform the above sequence of steps when starting an app. The following code sample demonstrates creating a notification channel with a low importance level, and a custom vibration pattern.

As it states ""perform the above sequence"" but there is no sequence above? So I'm not sure if they're missing, or if they're talking about the ones ""below"". Also, it when ""starting an app""... does that mean Application.onCreate()?

Any help would be splendid before I send this feature to my users. Especially if someone from the framework team could chime in.

**EDIT:** Also, they deprecated `new NotificationCompat.Builder(context)` and want you to use `new NotificationCompat.Builder(context, CHANNEL_ID)`, but when you use that, it still allows you to set a channel ID in the builder via `                .setChannelId(CHANNEL_ID_OTHER)` What's best practice there?",1502511630.0,2017-08-12 04:20:30,0.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/androiddev/comments/6syygl/its_almost_android_o_time_have_you_updated_to/

7211,How to see SDK sources when targetting API 26,"Just a quick tip, since it's been bothering me recently.

When targetting/compiling with API 26 we don't yet have sources in IDE, so navigating to, say, `Activity`, shows decompiled bytecode. 

However you can:

 - go to android sdk directory
 - go to `sources/` 
 - copy `android-25` as `android-26` 
 - change instances of `25` to `26` in `source.properties` and `package.xml` files in `android-26` directory
 - restart Android Studio 
 - enjoy sources of API 25 when targetting Android O :)


It's not ideal, but I suppose the changes aren't this drastic if you're not using new APIs, and Google should push sources for O soon enough.",1502533525.0,2017-08-12 10:25:25,25.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/androiddev/comments/6t08qk/how_to_see_sdk_sources_when_targetting_api_26/

We're trying to release an app which can be used for patients to help with their reading. We want to do a subscription based for a small fee. 

But we also need to be able to give it to clinician and doctors etc to be able to test and use themselves in order to see if they should be recommending it to patients. 

I've come across that promotion codes seem to only work for anything BUT subscriptions. 

Any ideas how I could still be able to give a version for free to doctors etc to use and be able to show their patients? I've thought perhaps about having a separate version under beta that we can send them - they can download from the app store and we give them a promotion code as you need to do in google's beta.

7228,Novice here. Is it ok to work for free to develop resume?,"Hi all. I very recently (past couple months) have gotten into Android development. My background is in engineering with mostly specific C++ programs made for conducting research. While I'm by no means even close to being ""intermediate"" in Android development, I really want to publish a real app. I've made a bunch of example apps that are pretty much teaching me basics of concepts in Android, but no full apps yet. I've kind of been racking my brain to come up with good app ideas to implement for publishing to the app store, but have issues with everything I come up with and can't decide to commit to anything. 

I noticed my local animal shelter doesn't have an Android app. I was thinking about approaching them and asking if they would be interested in me developing one. Now the reason I am bringing this up to you guys is I have never done anything like this and was wondering:


A. If this is a good idea to build a resume


B. How to even do this



If I do decide to do this, would doing it for free be a major chump move? I imagine it will take a good amount of time especially considering its my first big project. On the other hand, I don't have anything in my resume in Android development, so I don't know if they would be interested at all. My ideal timeline would be 


1. publish personal app --> 2. publish maybe another personal app --> 3. approach other companies/freelance opportunities with a decent resume


Obviously at that point I would be much more confident charging for my services. Anyways, sorry for the rambling and probably ignorance in my post, but I am very new at this and would love some guidance from some of the vets here. Thank you in advance!

I have an app that GPS tracks my runs and this app keeps an overview of all my past run activities.

1) Do I need two databases ? One of each run and one overllooking all the runs I have done in the past or are there better practices ?

2) Suppose I monitor more sensors for every run (acceleration, GPS, temperature, ...). What would be the best approach to save those for every run. I`d t hink it is hard to put all sensor loggins in one database since the monitoring intervals for all these sensors are different. Hence a different database for all these sensors ? Then in the database of a track can I make link to every sensor database ? What would be the best practices.

Note that I plan to connect my databases to firebase and make them social if that makes a difference for your feedback.

7237,Android strings.xml Easier Translation Web App,"Hi /r/androiddev!      

I have a project in a company I work in and it often needs translations.  
  
The way we did translations up to till this day was as follows:  
* I run a small script to turn the strings.xml file to a CSV file.  
* Pass the CSV file to my project manager.  
* She passes the CSV file usually in the form of google sheets to the client for translations.  
* After a while when the sheets file was translated I translate it back using a script to strings.xml file.    
  
The entire process is identical to the iOS side (only they don't use XML).  
I was thinking of building a simple java script web app that can receive strings.xml or an iOS file and transform it to a CSV file (and vice versa).    
  
I am hoping this tool will help me when I want to translate my personal project.

7246,How can I build an app for myself?,"Hoping someone could drop some knowledge for a complete noobie.

I'm looking to build an app for myself so that I can track my time, nothing I've used can fulfill this for me so I want to build it myself.


I want the following functionalities:

- create a few areas that you want to spend time on, select how much time per day you want to allocate

- have a timer to run for X amount of minutes (I'd only really need 30 mins if that makes it any different)

- when you run the timer, select which area you're putting the time into, and then phone would go off

- some sort of tracking functionality, be able to look at a desired area and see ""I should've spent 2 hours on this. I've only spent 30 mins so far. I have 1.5 hours left""

- another tracking functionality to see for a day/week/month, say 5 areas you want to spend time on. How much time you should've for each one, how much time you spent for each one, what the difference is


I'm a complete noobie with no programming background. I'd consider myself good with computers (all relative of course). I've googled easy way to build apps, and there are apps designed to easily build apps. However they seem very simple functionality and not what I'm looking for at all.

Ultimately, I'm looking for the sweet spot between easy to build and it being functional as per the above needs. The easier to build, the better.

Please can someone let me know how I would go about this?

Also just by typing the cpu would go crazy (200%-300%). Finally, i decided i had enough and started debugging to see what the hell is going on.


By checking the Android Studio logs i saw crashlytics was making a **HTTP request every second**. It looked something like [this](https://i.imgur.com/ZF8ygiQ.png).

So i decided to disable it for debug builds **ext.enableCrashlytics = false**, no improvement. Next, i uninstalled the AS Crashlytics plugin and any related code in gradle + restart.

Build time **with Crashlytics**:

* 2 mins (First build)
* 50 secs 
* 49 secs 

Build time **without Crashlytics**:

* 26 secs (First build)

7256,Handling SharedPreferences in onPause() and onResume(),"Is there a problem with saving all my data (like 10 variables, maybe later more) in the onPause method and load them back in in onResume? This looks like a pretty easy way to handle everything and make sure that the data is always there. Also if i do this, do i need intent.putExtra() at all? Where is the limit on how much workload i can put into onPause() and onResume()? What will happen if its too much, will leaving and joining the app be laggy?

7259,Battery health vs. keeping device always charged on 100% while developing,"Today I've noticed that S8+ that I've got since preorder started to discharge quickly from 100% to 90% without heavy operations on device... That's make me sad, because battery is not replaceable there :(


I know about WiFI ADB, and I'm thinking about using it more now, but really keeping phone charged 100% is more harmful than wasting charging cycles? I thought that device battery is not used while charged to 100%, and devices is just taking juice from USB (I've got active hub, so it should have enough amps)


For example, I've got MacBook connected all the time to MagSafe, and I see no problems with battery life there (used for most of a day, for over 1.5 years and 125 cycles on counter)

7300,How to get back up to speed with Android?,"So I'm a self-taught android developer. I studied for about a year and a half--online courses, textbooks, lots of my own small apps, tons of java problem sets, etc. I got myself to the point where I could start interviewing and I landed an apprenticeship at a mobile dev company. My time there went really well and I of course learned even more. When it was over though, I had a tough time with my job search. After a few months without any success I got depressed and sort of gave up(far too easily, I know). 

But now I'm back and I'm determined to make a career for myself as a developer.  The problem is that it's been months since I've done any kind of work and I fell very far removed from Android in general. For about six weeks of my apprenticeship, I was doing the work of a junior dev, and I honestly don't feel I'm equipped to do that today. 

I'm hoping someone can give me some advice on how to at least get back to where I was. I've got a lot of experience teaching myself, but going from nothing to something is a much different process than refreshing what I already know, and I'm kind of unsure how to proceed.

7320,I've received a mail from Google about BIND_DEVICE_ADMIN.,"Hi all,

I've just received a mail from Google about the fact that my application uses the BIND_DEVICE_ADMIN permission.

They give me 7 days to correct this before removing the app from the PlayStore.

As a matter of facts, my app is an alarm app and I'm using this permission to be able to switch off the screen after stopping an alarm.

In the email, there's indication about how to correct the issue.
One of them is to simply put “This app uses the Device Administrator permission.” in the PlayStore description.

Could this be enough?

I don't want to risk anything so I'm removing the feature for the time being. But still... 
Putting a sentence with so little explanation for the end-user, somewhere in a block a text... Could this provide enough security from Google's point of vue?",1502887808.0,2017-08-16 12:50:08,14.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/androiddev/comments/6tuavo/ive_received_a_mail_from_google_about_bind_device/

I'm the creator of the [Android Developer discord](https://discord.gg/0zmO5t1MjrqeJEUE) I post every so often on here, I just wanted to give everyone a quick announcement as to how we're restructuring the server to make it easier and more intuitive to chat and be social.

First major thing is that we are splitting up beginner and intermediate android discussion into separate channels, so users who know more than beginner don't have to fight for channel space and the beginners can easily get the help they need.


One rather major change is now the addition of a design channel and a designer role to go with it! Once Discord text channel categories are released we will be splitting it up into separate areas (UI, UX, Material, etc.) But for now we will stick with this, so even if you don't program, and just design, feel free to join!


We're slowly approaching 1000 users so the mods and I figured it was time for a little bit of a restructure. 

I hope you guys check it out! We have a decent amount of notable devs in there, a lot of helpful devs too!

7348,Main advantages to Architecture Components -&gt; LiveData?,"TL;DR why the heck do we need LiveData?

&amp;nbsp;

As most of you know Google released it's Official Guide to Android App Architecture [here](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture/guide.html). I was working through their [GithubBrowserSample](https://github.com/googlesamples/android-architecture-components/tree/e33782ba54ebe87f7e21e03542230695bc893818/GithubBrowserSample) and I am still struggling a bit with LiveData and its purpose, especially when used with ViewModels:
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;
Why do I need to observe (via LiveData) in the fragment when I can observe (via Rx) in the ViewModel? What advantage does it offer? I understand the advantages the LiveData offers, but not when combined with ViewModels:  

&amp;nbsp;

&gt; * No memory leaks: Since the Observers are bound to their own Lifecycle objects, they are automatically cleaned when their Lifecycle is destroyed.

&amp;nbsp;

This is kind of nice, but you could simply clean up your own observables in the ViewModel.  

&amp;nbsp;

&gt; * No crashes due to stopped activities: If the Observer’s Lifecycle is inactive (like an activity in the back stack), they won’t receive change events.  

&amp;nbsp;

This can't happen since your ViewModel is lifecycle independent.

&amp;nbsp;

&gt; * Always up to date data: If a Lifecycle starts again (like an activity going back to started state from the back stack) it receives the latest location data (if it didn’t already).

&amp;nbsp;

My understanding is that the ViewModel will persist until the activity is destroyed, so the original ViewModel would reattach via ViewModelProvider (and hence get the latest data).

&amp;nbsp;

&gt; * Proper configuration change: If an activity or fragment is re-created due to a configuration change (like device rotation), it instantly receives the last available Location data.

&amp;nbsp;

Same answer as the one before.

&amp;nbsp;

&gt; * Sharing Resources: Now we can keep a single instance of MyLocationListener, connect to the system service just once, and properly support all observers in the app.

&amp;nbsp;

This can be accomplished easily without LiveData.

&amp;nbsp;

&gt; * No more manual lifecycle handling: As you might notice, our fragment just observes the data when it wants to, does not worry about being stopped or start observing after being stopped. LiveData automatically manages all of this since the fragment provided its Lifecycle while observing.

&amp;nbsp;

This point seems redundant.

&amp;nbsp;

My understanding is that LiveData kind of replaces Rx, which is totally fine, except it is almost harder to use. Maybe when they make LiveData usable with DataBinding (which I think is coming in the first stable release) I would have less of an issue with it, but am I missing something?",1502986329.0,2017-08-17 16:12:09,11.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/androiddev/comments/6u3ilt/main_advantages_to_architecture_components/

Disclaimer: my name is Zeke, I'm the founder of [Keygen](https://keygen.sh), a software licensing REST API. I'm not too involved with the Android dev community, but I wanted to see if anybody here sells apps outside of the Play Store.

So I've been digging around a bit within the Android ecosystem and realized that devs actually distribute/sell apps outside of the Play Store (something not possible for iOS devs so I originally assumed the same for Android). Would Android devs be interested in a licensing system like Keygen and maybe a Kotlin API client library? (Yes, I _might_ be looking for an excuse to learn Kotlin. 😜)

When I go to Tools-&gt;Android-&gt;SDK Manager, I noticed I can not click on anything. 



I can't click anything under SDK Platforms including the ""Show Package Details"" check box. The only two platforms checked are ""Android API 26"" and ""Android 7.1.1"". ""Android API 26"" is marked as Partially Installed. However I can't do anything about it since I can't click on anything. I can not uncheck nor check anything else. 



I can't even click on the ""SDK Tools"" tab nor the ""SDK Update Sites"" tab. 



My ""Android SDK Location"" contains one white space in the form of my User (my_first_name &lt;space&gt; my_last_name). There is a warning under that saying there should not be any white space. But as far as I know, I can not change that folder now. Can this be the source of the problem?

7355,"Random thought: if we use subcomponents for Activities/Fragments and actually bind their instance, then shouldn't these components have a super-scope for their associated ViewModel/Scope (which are subcomponents of the AppComponent)?","The whole `AndroidInjection.inject(this)` was always bugging me a bit, because you get a component that has the Context bound as part of the module, therefore is retained by the component. This means that retaining the component would cause memory leak.

But this also means that your component can no longer provide scoped data and scoped dependencies (i.e. presenter) because the component has to be killed alongside the view.

---------

I started wondering if the `ViewModel` (or any other such associated scope that survives config change) should have its own subcomponent, and the ActivityComponent which binds the instance of Activity could provide the Activity-level stuff which *does* need an Activity-context.

Of course, `AndroidInjection` is super-rigid, so I'm pretty sure it wouldn't support this - but then again, what's the point of subscoping if your component doesn't match the scope (meaning it's torn down with config changes)?

So there would be 3 scopes

     AppComponent
           |
     ViewModelScope
           |
     ActivityScope

Does anyone have experience using Espresso (and IdlingResources) when working on legacy apps? If the app uses RxJava for all the background work, then it is easy enough to make IdlingResource work.

You'd have to figure out all the right places to put the IdlingResources (polluting your production code), which isn't a trivial ask when the codebase is large.

 I have an app with multiple Activities and Fragments, all of which have a corresponding View and Presenter. 

At the moment, To inject my presenter, I am having to create a separate Module and Component for **each** individual Fragment and Activity, so that I can provide the view.

What are your ways to implement presenter injection? I feel it seems over kill to have an individual component and module for every single Activity and Fragment, when for most, I am just providing the View in it.

 Would it be better to just have a @PerActivity Module and somehow provide the presenter with the view a different way? How would I achieve this?

7417,Learning android development with kotlin,"Hi guys,

About a week ago I asked the question which language to choose to get started in android development, kotlin or java([link to thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/androiddev/comments/6s65ft/which_language_to_choose_to_start_with_android/)), because kotlin seemed like a very nice language I chose kotlin. It is now about a week later and I've read the kotlin reference manual and did the basic koans. Now that I know the syntax and the basics of kotlin I went on to the android development part. 

Yesterday I got started, I did the first and second 'part' of [Google's getting started guide](https://developer.android.com/training/index.html). The third part was about fragments and I found it a bit difficult to grasp with this guide and it seemed like a sudden big step forward from building a simple user interface. So I started looking for courses to get started with android development. I found a list in a thread on this subreddit of android development courses: [list](https://github.com/Enteleform/-RES-/blob/master/%5BLinks%5D/%5BAndroid%5D%20Udacity%20Curriculum.md). I chose [app development 1](https://www.udacity.com/course/new-android-fundamentals--ud851) as they didn't start from the ground learning you Java, I knew the course was in Java but I thought I'd give it a try. However apparently the course works with excersises. To me this doesn't seem like a good way to learn android with kotlin as it would mean converting all the code and documentation they provide to kotlin. So I searched and found a book called [Kotlin for android developers](https://antonioleiva.com/kotlin-android-developers-book/). However this assumes that you are already a bit fammiliar with the android sdk(and Java, although I can read that quite well as I programmed in C# for about two years) which I am not. 

So my question basically is: what is the best way to learn android development with kotlin? As the Android sdk is huge and I don't know about a lot of the things I wanna make sure I know the basics(like how to make a user interface) in the right way.",1503162312.0,2017-08-19 17:05:12,2.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/androiddev/comments/6uipfr/learning_android_development_with_kotlin/

7420,What else do I need to land a job as an Android Developer?,"Hello,

To give a short introduction. I am a recent CS postgrad (graduated last month) and I am eager to land a job as a Android developer. As for experience, I have published an app on the Play Store (an okay Gallery app) that I have written from scratch. I also contributed to an opensource Android mHealth client called mUzima and worked on the OpenMRS.org platform (Java/Spring). I was pretty happy with the contributions for that project, although the Android client side development was fairly trivial on my part that I didn't find it too challenging.

So, for the past few weeks I have to applying for various Android developer positions across the Bay Area. I got few interviews that went really good, however they decided to go an another way. I'm not discouraged by it, although I feel I should do more to improve my portfolio for Android development. I really like working on the platform and my Java skills are fairly adept. However, I am in need of some ideas and need to pull out some time to develop another app.

I'm right now in the crossroads of a change, my overall experience is all over the board and I wish to streamline it to better my chances. 

Here's a snapshot of my resume: http://i.imgur.com/4mDVnb2.png

I have a website listed on that resume, however that needs some work to display my portfolio.

I could create a SQL DB that has 3 or so tables (online_users, active_challenges, challenge_requests and users) then on the android side, I’d create a background service that calls a php api that checks the DB to see if there are any challenge request for the user... 

Is my way ok? Or are there any existing technologies that can prevent me from inventing the wheel.

As the game progresses, more special blocks will emerge. Destroying special blocks gives points and coins, which can be used to unlock different themes. Who is aHi Labs? We are a new game studio from Istanbul! We love board games and old school puzzle games. What motivated you to make this game? We wanted to make a game that would have both the essence of old school puzzle games and the modern gameplay mechanics. The idea of destroying special blocks by combining 4 matching color blocks in line is actually coming from the Nintendo classic Dr. Mario, which is a game we loved to play in the past. What is special about Foor? It has a different yet very simple gameplay mechanic which allows users to start playing and enjoying the game in seconds. But it requires strategic thinking to be able to keep going as the game advances with more special blocks, which makes the game very addictive. Is it an endless puzzle game? Yes! Foor has no levels, no life or time limits. Players can collect coins by destroying special blocks and unlock 4 different themes with those coins which are beautifully designed and so much fun to play with. More themes will be added with updates very soon.",1503178998.0,2017-08-19 21:43:18,0.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/androiddev/comments/6ukagb/drmario_inspired_new_puzzle_game_foor/

7437,Custom rom or root for system apps?,"I'd like to customize an android device for my grandmother and the apps I want to write will need to have system permissions (I want my dialer to be in system, for example).  

I also need the ability to update these system apps remotely -- so that I can add more features as she slowly learns the tech: it's going to be a long term project.  This means I need to write a system app that can install/update other (potentially) system apps.

Would a rooted device on vanilla android be sufficient?  Or should I take the extra step and do my own custom rom?  If I sign my own custom rom, I should be able to also install packages to system by writing a system package installer, right?

What I've tried: I bought a really cheap phone, wrote my own launcher and dialer plus a few utility apps.  Turns out, after much tracing of logs, the manufacture's rom refuses to let any other app directly dial a number, which is a no go.  I was unable to root or unlock the bootloader for the phone, so it seems to be a bust.  

This is why I'm not taking any chances on the next phone and am getting one where I can put vanilla android on it (I'm thinking about a Sony Xperia -- they seem very friendly towards this kind of stuff).",1503208967.0,2017-08-20 06:02:47,0.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/androiddev/comments/6umpe4/custom_rom_or_root_for_system_apps/

7441,Trying to Rxify an already asynchronous flow,"I have a situation before me wherein I already have an asynchronous system in place and I'm looking to convert it to Rx streams. The flow is a part of a 3rd party library without me having the source to modify. So I'm looking to create a Rx wrapper around it.

Can't share the exact code here but to give a brief idea, I have created a singleton class which acts as a manager for this flow. In the singleton class, I have initialised the object of some class that is present in the 3rd party library. During the initialisation of this object, I have to pass a reference of a callback class in the constructor and this is the callback where the library provides responses to all the method calls asynchronously.

Callback callback = new Callback() {  
public void onResponse(Message message) {  
// Perform action  
}  
};  
SomeClassInSdk clazz = new SomeClassInSdk(callback);  

What I'm looking to do here is convert this async system to Rx streams and I can't seem to figure out how to begin with it as me being a newbie to Rxjava2.

I tried to replicate the code of Retrofit RxJava2 adapter code but it has a new Callback object initialised for every observable which I can't have in my code.

7450,Do I need a college degree? Or just keep pushing?,"Hey all - might post this to /r/cscareerquestions as well, just wanted people's opinions here.

Cliff Notes:

* Have 2 years independent exp.
* Can't get job without experience. Can't get experience without job.
* Completed Nanodegree courses by Udacity.
* App on Play Store.
* Should I enroll in local community college (more knowledge and internship opportunities) or just keep pushing?

Long Version:

So about 2 1/2 years ago I discovered programming. Started with basic web dev and transitioned into Android. I've been doing it on a personal/independent level for about 2 years now. About 4 months ago I started applying for jobs for Android Developer (never see Jr postings and I always inform them of my position), and internships that I see posted. I've gotten a few interviews, some have gone 3-4 interviews long. I mesh well with the dev's and people I speak with and generally their ""concerns"" are that I do not have professional experience. I have had two companies tell me specifically ""you would be a good fit for our culture and needs but we need to ramp up production and we need someone with professional/team exp"". Is this just a BS excuse or does it seem normal?

I am 31 looking for a career change, is it worth it to go to a local community college for CS for that extra boost and possibly an internship, since most that I see posted require you to be a college student. I have completed the Nanodegree's by Udacity, read a few books (Big Nerd Ranch 2nd edition, Head First Java, Head First Android. Just got Clean Code). I have a GitHub with 20+ small applications. An app on the play store. And continuing to learn daily. What can I do to get my career started? 

I currently live in Colorado. What should I be looking for compensation wise given my situation (going rate of Jr Dev out here is around $75,000/year according to glassdoor)? Any advice is appreciated. Thanks - sorry for the long post.

I can only test on emulated devices so far, but I must say I like the API of AAudio (OpenSL works fine, but is quite a hassle to setup) and initial results seem to be not worse than OpenSL ;)

I've never worked as a developer before, so this is my first paid offer. The goal requires me to do digital signal processing, which I haven't touched before. So this gig has a steep learning curve and I'm up to the challenge, but don't know how to estimate my time to do it. I'm guessing 1-2 months.

Would it be okay to say something like, this could take me two months, but it's possible it will take less?

For payment, should I ask for a deposit up front? The deposit would pay for bills (rent/food/utilities)? If we move to the second month, another deposit?",1503348976.0,2017-08-21 20:56:16,26.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/androiddev/comments/6uyik1/received_an_offer_to_freelance_not_sure_on_how_to/

7553,Recent Android interview questions,"I applied to a few Android Dev positions. I've been working with it for about 2 years, mostly personal and small freelance apps handed over to a client. In the past worked mostly in the Windows world and PHP. 

One app was distributed to 100s of servicemen on the job on their tablets but never made it to the appstore. It is under NDA. Honestly, I hate searching for clients. And the clients I dealt with were looking to pay the least and expected the most. One told me I could go on the site again and find someone less than you so be thankful you have the job. This is after I asked for a bit extra for additional work.

Anyway, getting a real Android job has proven a bit difficult. My resume has stuff going back to the mid-90s, so either it scares people off or I get a call.

Here is how I blew a job that claimed to pay 150k :(.

I said I use a headless fragment. 

2) How can you use RxJava to track lifecycle events.

I said I'm not sure. But I answered other questions about Rx. I've used it in my apps.

2a) Quick, explain Rx Map vs Flatmap!
Flatmap returns an observable, map can return anything. I remember that MAP in functional programming by nature is to transform things. Flatmap is the ""boring version.""

3) Explain why you would use Preferences vs SQLLite?

I said prefs are a key-store type database, and SQL lite is a full blown SQL platform. Depends on what you want to retain.

4) Explain why you need an interface in Android

I said it is one way of enforcing that method exists in a certain class. It is very useful for event callbacks, that we are sure a method by that name is available to the caller. An interface means IN YOUR FACE and forces implementation of its methods. Abstract classes are ""abstract"" and laid back and don't really make you do anything. That is a good way of remembering it. 

5) In a live coding session, write pseudocode for cross Fragment events without interfaces.

I used GreenRobot, wrote an EventMessage class. Also remembered to stop it with the lifecycle events. He said excellent.

6) Ok, nice. Now imagine GreenRobot isn't available. Do it in Rx Java. 

I thought a bit about and cobbled something together using a static class. I don't think it was a good answer. He had no comment.

7)Why do you need WeakReferences?
So a full copy of the Activity isn't retained and you don't have memory leaks.

8)Why is an inner class in an activity bad?
Because static references cause memory leaks.

9) What is your experience with Android MVVM?
I said I used it as a wpf dev, but never in Android. (Should have lied)

10) Walk me thru a retrofit/Rx API call
I sorta talked thru it, with the backing class that maps JSON to a POJO (there is a site that does it for you). I also had a code sample on Github we discussed. My code sample just retrieved straight HTML, but the idea is similar.

11) Explain how retrofit could be required to be in a thread and how it can work in its own thread.

I said there are a variety of ways of calling it, three to be exact. Some run on their own thread. I forgot the exact details :(. He said to try to write the method signatures for each...

12) How would you diagnose Https Network calls?
I said either using Stetho or Fiddler proxy. 

13) Explain a Broadcast Receiver and two ways of implementing it.

Ok, nothing remarkable here, I said either in the manifest or with an IntentFilter and register receiver.

14) Write code to check if a fragment exists.
I always copypasta this, but I explained it well. getSupportFramentManger, tags, etc.
I have a shitty memory for this.

15) How would you keep 3 fragments in memory and assure they aren't destroyed?

I said there is an option on the TabView to set a count of retained fragments. Forgot the exact property.

15a) Why would Android destroy a fragment?
I said low memory on the device could be a reason.

16) A very specific question about one of the less used fragment lifecycle events and if it is called before or after a certain activity event.
Just guessed.

17) Do you use butterknife or dagger2?
Yes, had code samples.

18) Discuss RecyclerView, even he admitted he just copypastaed it for an app this morning.
I mentioned the Adapter class, view holder, etc. 

19) How would you load an image in RecyclerView?
I said I use Picassa.

20) PC or Mac
Both, depending on the mood.

21) Explain how you would create an API.
I discussed how I would likely use PHP and Laravel/Lumen, create a MySQL db, set up routes, etc.

22) What is a load balancer?
I said if you have lots of website traffic it moves requests between servers.

23) POST vs GET
Blah blah, kids stuff.

24) Explain a Laravel or Rails intermediate/Pivot table
Said if you have a situation where you want to map users to roles, and a role could have many users.

25-30) more backend questions, some were tricky. Got tripped up on one hard SQL question. Others had no problem with.

(P.S. The job description said this is NOT a backend position)

31) Implement a linked list in Java while we are on the phone. No Google. Don't have to be perfect. Ok, I did it and wrote a method to insert and traverse it.

Ok, he said not bad, you are definitely getting considered.

A few days later I got a dear John letter :(. I figure for a position like this I'm competing with guys like Jake Wharton, so I don't feel so bad.  I'm not famous online.

This is my 4th Android interview. One I did get but the pay was really low. Think a bit above the new NYC fast food wages :(, they are in NYC. It was remote though, and they had quite high expectations.

7558,Becoming an Android Expert could be a risky career move. Am I wrong?,"Rant

Just to give some perspective, I've been developing software for pay since HS in the very early 90s.

Android reminds me a bit of VB or even early MS MFC/C++. It was once a very valuable skill and you could make almost today's wages in the late-90s. I made 100k then as an expert VB dev and writing dlls in C++. I used a database called Btrieve. Not the point. The idea is that tech is completely extinct now and no employer would care if you knew it. Some people may have a job where they work on this for a decade or more, and they are practically unemployable.  I recently talked to a colleague that I worked with back then, and he was finally let go. The company moved all their dev to an outside consulting firm. He told me is his experience is worthless in today's market. No way is he going to get 170K with those skills. So he is back on the treadmill and competing with the 1-2 year experience crowd.  He is not a manager type but a decent coder, but old school with out all the public exposure a young programmer would be comfortable with.

Java on it is own is a very valuable programming language, but I had places tell me that they wouldn't consider an Android dev for a Java position. Now with Kotlin it is moving into a niche language that will only exist for Android (yeah, it is JVM, but I doubt companies are rushing to convert their Legacy Java codebase).

The Android environment is constantly in flux. If you work 5 years doing Android, your job marketability exists in a very niche, competitive market. If you aren't a Kotlin expert by then, you will likely be invisible to companies. Possibly by then, Kotlin will be the new VB and you will have to be an expert in Brainfuck%%. 

I do Android dev but I also do .net and PHP work. I love Android but I'm scared to lock myself into one technology.

7585,Resource generating gradle task,"I'm working on a gradle task that processed some images from the source folders and saved them in the merged resources folder.

At first this task was running between ""mergeResources"" and ""processResources"" and it was running well but it screwed with the build cache. With every build the ""mergeResources"" task was out-of-date because inside the ""build/intermediates/res/merged"" folder the updated images were different than when the task ran last time.

Now I moved the task before ""mergeResources"" and get the files from the source folders (in the previous method I got the files from the ""build/intermediates/res/merged"" build folder) and save them to ""build/generated/res/plugin/flavor/buildtype/"". For the merge task to take my folder into consideration I had to do some hacks:

                    val resourceSet = ResourceSet(""ApiSecretObfuscator"", ""com.domain.common.crypto:1.1.0"")
                    resourceSet.isFromDependency = true

                    val mergeTask = project.tasks.findByName(""merge${buildConfiguration}Resources"") as MergeResources
                    resourceSet.addSource(obfuscateDebugApiSecretKeyTask.getOutputDir())

                    mergeTask.dependsOn.add(obfuscateDebugApiSecretKeyTask)
                    val newResourceSet = mutableListOf(resourceSet)
                    newResourceSet.addAll(mergeTask.inputResourceSets)

7589,Android interview at-home coding challenges - what are employers looking for?,"Question based on the recent interview thread that has gained a lot of attention.

For coding challenges, what are employers really looking for?

I've taken a number of android coding challenges to do at home for jobs and they usually follow a pretty similar flow. First, do this GET request which returns some json array. Then display this json array as a list on the screen. Then select an item in the list to view details of whichever item you clicked.

Some have been very vague about user stories, some have been very specific. I remember one pretty much didn't ask for anything and then the feedback I got back was something like ""didn't include a search feature, didn't include a sort feature, no ability to filter items out of the list, etc etc etc"". Am I supposed to churn out something worthy of publishing on the app store in only a couple hours for an interview?

I've been turned down for a couple jobs based on the coding challenge with very little feedback. I usually have no problem completing them and I feel like my code is clean and solid, adheres to material design standards, uses appropriate libraries, and follows MVP architecture (if given enough time). Still get turned down. What gives? What are they searching for and what am I missing?

For context, my most recent coding challenge involved reading a json file, making a recyclerview, going into an item's details screen. They gave a 3 hour time limit to do it. So of course I took some shortcuts and used activities, no fragments or real architecture. No unit tests. I just got it done quickly and tried my best to make it look nice with material icons and spacing for the text. Threw in a sort feature at the end. When submitting it, I stated that with more time I would focus on architecture (make it MVP), and acknowledged some decisions I made to create shortcuts.

7596,I wish there were a better way for the developer address policy for paid apps on Google Play.,"I had read that you must disclose your address if you want to sell paid apps. There was a lengthy comment debate for this. Some independent developers hated it for privacy reasons and some said if they cannot disclose their address, they should not sell apps in the first place.

So, I opened the Play Store, and examined the top paid apps. You need to click ""Read more"" and scroll down to the bottom, to see the developer's address. All apps from companies listed their full address of the office... except that good old ES Explorer Pro (who dodged the open-source licence terms). They had just put their home page URL there. Some independent developers (because the developer name looked like their personal name) had put only a partial address like ""Mumbai, India."" ES Explorer Pro has been there for long and should have been pretty conspicuous to Google.  If they had been able to get away with such an obvious fake address for such long time, it might be that Google does not actually check for valid addresses.

Anyways, I think there could be a better solution for this situation. Independent developers do not have an office, so they do not want to disclose their home address to the public where anyone can see. App buyers want developers' addresses to be available to prevent harmful and malicious apps on the Store. But most of the time, probably 99.99% of the time, app buyers do not need to know the home address of the developer. I mean, what are they going to do with that, visit the developer's house for a refund or a bug report? So, how about Google verifies developers' actual addresses and keeps it themselves securely, and discloses the address to the buyer of the apps, only if the buyer finds some malicious problems with it, such as privacy problems?

If the problems are technical ones like ""this game keeps crashing!"" or ""it does not really do what it was supposed to do!"", there is no need for the buyer to know the developer's address. Google can simply refund the app, unless the developer disagrees (then Google may disclose the developer's address to the buyer to help them to solve the dispute with each other). Only for problems like malicious activities or privacy matters, the buyer can request the developer's address to Google, and Google hands the address over to the buyer.

This way, independent developers' home addresses are not wide open to the public on the internet, and the buyers are still protected. How about that?",1503594074.0,2017-08-24 17:01:14,2.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/androiddev/comments/6vkpwk/i_wish_there_were_a_better_way_for_the_developer/

Hi all!

We've noticed that sometimes it's difficult to test the integration of an app using MediaSession(Compat) with other applications (such as Android Auto, Wear, or the Google Assistant).

In an effort to help, a colleague and I built this tool that can connect to other apps that utilize MediaBrowserService(Compat) and exposes the media TransportControls in a simple UI. 

Since those apps also use the media TransportControls, it can make tracking down bugs a lot easier. (For example, perhaps the app doesn't respond well if it gets a call to ""onPrepareFromSearch"" followed shortly by ""onPlayFromSearch""!)

We'd love to hear feedback if there's any features you think are missing or if you find any bugs.",1503612948.0,2017-08-24 22:15:48,15.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/androiddev/comments/6vmt75/android_media_controller_test_tool/

7629,How much would it cost to have a menu program/app developed?,"I've been looking for information about this type of software for a really long time and in short:

I'm looking at how much time/money would be spent to develop a simple self serve menu that prints out the order (with a receipt printer). No wifi or internet needs really it just needs to simply print things that are pressed.

I was thinking of a simple menu but has description/photo when an item is pressed. Just Food 1, option a, option b, another item? yes/no

My only focus really is the aesthetics ie. has smooth transitions, has a small animation when items are pressed (like a real button etc) or maybe a ding with every button.

- How much time/money should I be prepared to spend?
- Would it be a lot more expensive if it had the options of me being able to add/remove items occasionally? (and not have to do coding)
- I'm not really that strict with my own time, should I really just learn or is this far too advanced?

I don't really know much about app developing but I could learn if I really really need to(ie. when changing menu items). I'm also located somewhere that is a little cheaper than US in terms of programming costs but if its better to outsource overseas then I will look into it. I have other questions but I really don't want to be spamming..

7646,How do you monetize old assets and products?,"I saw [this thread on Flippa](https://flippa.com/8971440-puissant-apps-portfolio-of-20-apps) where a dev is selling 20 games making $800/mo for $20k. The comments say his valuation should be $14.4k tops. 

I have a ton of old apps (30+) I no longer update which make more than this, and would consider throwing on Flippa for a 1.5X valuation, but I don't have the time to walk a buyer through each app.

So now I'm wondering, 

1. What do you do with your old assets? Keep em up until your monthly hits $0? Sell off the artwork/audio on stock sites?

2. Does anyone have experience doing this, and can you share your experience? Especially with what happens after the sale?

3. Are there third-party consultants that anyone's worked with or would recommend?

If a 1.5X+ valuation is doable, I might try selling an app or two soon and would follow-up here if anyone's interested.

before I start, I would like to apologize for bad wording or such, English is not my first language and I'm having a bit of a hard time putting my thoughts down properly. I am also new to this field, so sorry if I come up with no-brainers.     

I want to develop an app, aka a game that comes from a famous TV show. What I mean, is, that I want to use looks and voices of the characters which appear in the show, possibly music.    

For the music I am most certain that I'd have to get in touch with the company that holds the rights but I don't know about the rest.    

I am planning to do drawings/character creation myself and not use any existing content, though it would be hard anyway to do the latter.   

I hope I was able to express myself clearly enough, if not please let me know, I'll do my best to explain.    

If this is the wrong sub and it would be better off somewhere else, please let me know where.

Thanks in advance!

7685,Need an answer on whether the Google Maps Android API really is free unlimited use.,"Hi,
  

My first post - so please be a little understanding! I did search for answers..
  

I'm about to release my first Andriod App on the playstore.. I was hoping to sell it for $1. The app uses the **Google Maps Android API** to show your current location before delivering information on services around you.


According to [Pricing and Plans](https://developers.google.com/maps/pricing-and-plans/) this API offers free unlimited usage. - The footnote (1) states: ""Includes paid apps through an online store and internal Android apps as allowed by the Standard Plan Terms of Service. For other applications, you should contact sales to discuss a Premium Plan license."" 


However, the Standard Plan Terms of Service offers conflicting advice..


**9.1.1** (a) Free access (no fees). Subject to Section 9.1.2 (Exceptions), your Maps API Implementation must be accessible to the general public without charge and must not require a fee-based subscription or other fee-based restricted access.


**9.1.2** (b) (i) The rule in Section 9.1.1(a) (Free access) does not apply if your Maps API Implementation is used in a mobile application that is sold for a fee through an online store and is downloadable to a mobile device that can access the online store.


This Suggests that it's not allowed.. but then:


**9.1.3** Examples.

b. You can charge a fee for your Maps API Implementation if it is an Android application downloadable to mobile devices from the Google Play Store.


Hmmmm


Under **10.4** Restrictions on Unfair Exploitation of the Service and Content.


b. No use beyond transaction limits and usage policies. If your Maps API Implementation generates a high volume of transactions, Google reserves the right to set transaction limits, as described in the Maps APIs Documentation here.


So.. lets go to the [FAQ](https://developers.google.com/maps/faq#usage-limits)

Which Google Maps APIs have usage limits?

Google Maps APIs are free for a wide variety of use cases, with complimentary usage limits and predictable overage pricing for use of the standard APIs, and annual contracts available for enterprise deployments.

The following APIs do not have usage limits:

Google Maps Android API

Google Maps SDK for iOS

Google Maps Embed API

...


So I sent feedback to Google via the developers page.. and they rang me. - we've had a number of discussions.

Despite reading over the pages above (with me on the phone) he stated that the documentation is wrong.. despite saying it's free unlimited use; it's not.. you have to pay for over 2500 hits a day.


Problem is - I'm not convinced.. so I asked for him to confirm it in writing.. and (if true) you might want to change the developers site as it's clearly misleading.


So I'd like to ask you experts for real experience.. is this particular API free to use - or not?


The concept of any sales model where you sell for a unit price of X but get charged ongoing fees forever is never a good idea.. it just doesn't make sense that I could be charged daily/monthly for the rest of my life for an app I sold for $1 (and only got 70c).


Also, I understand it's easy to unzip/decompile an apk to get the key from a resources file.. 

No one seems to have a good way of protecting it in the wild.. so someone could steal my key and make 1,000s of web hits... this is ridiculous... if the key is free to use; who cares; but if I'm responsible for the billing.. not acceptable.

Can some wise heads set me straight? 

I don't expect to make any/much money from this app.. but I really
don't want to lose money on it!

Thanks
Roscoe67

7695,Can I/should I do anything if I notice someone is copying my app?,"I noticed a developer on the play store has obviously plagiarised my app. Judging by his update pattern it looks like he's checking when I release patches and copying over the code into his app.

Does this break some policy in Google TOS? Should I be increasing APK obfuscation? Should I just ignore it because it's part of Android development?

**My App:**
https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.printandpixel.lolhistory

**His App:**
https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.lolink.livematchs

I've had people steal parts of my design work before but I didn't care too much but this one is just so... complete.

Any thoughts or experiences?

**Edit:** it appears the app can't be installed on any of my devices. This potentially explains how I found it in the first place - App Annie tried to connect it as my own app. Could this be because by copying the source he ended copying my application id as well?

**Edit 2:** should I not tell anyone and try new security methods to see if I can make it impossible for him to steal?

**UPDATE:** the app was very easy to decompile and copy because I accidentally switched minifyEnabled to false on release at some point... probably during testing of IAB and never changed it back. Starting with fixing that and contacting google play about the impersonation are the first steps I'm going to take.

I was hesitant but finally decided to try and root it . Unfortunately my stupid ass forgot to make any back up what so ever and now it seems like the tab is pretty much dead . I used odin and then installed SuperSU from TWRP via zip . When the tab booted it straight said that it needs formating . Tried to wipe it and it said that it cant mount data or something of that sort . Then I found someone who suggested that changing the data format type to other type and then back to default would help with that issue , but I was not able to find out what the default format is so I just fiddled with all of the types with no success. When I try to factory reset - nothing happens , when I try wiping everything it still has no effect . Turning it off doesnt achieve anything since it instantly restarts into recovery . I think I have dig deep enough grave on my own so I finaly decided to ask for any advice on how to proceed . Thank you in advance .

Edit : I was able to get into download mode with the power off function and instantly holding the combination before the recovery boot starts .

7763,ConstraintLayout Editor LPT,"I just saw a post inquiring as to whether or not people are having success with ConstraintLayout. The vibe of that post was that people are having success, but only when using the XML. 

As the OP stated in that post, that's not the point of ConstraintLayout, but others were right in stating that that did make usage of the technology ""easier.""

I hopped on the ConstraintLayout train early and was actually lucky enough to be working at Google when it was announced company wide. I got my hands on the earliest version of Studio that was available with ConstraintLayout and immediately ran into issues. For simple positioning of things, it worked great, and the Constraints were really cool. However, the editor just kept shitting the bed.

My solution: keep your layouts modular and as small as possible, and &lt;include/&gt; them in the ""host"" layout. My reasoning for this is as follows: I've found that ConstraintLayout editor gets worse and worse as you try to do any kind of nesting. This nesting can be as simple as using a ConstraintLayout on top of a CardView, or other examples I can't come up with right now. So, while plopping a ConstraintLayout on top of the CardView will completely annihilate any chance you have of using the WYSIWYG editor, ***including*** the layout from another layout file on top of the CardView will (in my experience most generally speaking) work perfectly. 

Sometimes this requires a little more thought, as certain views that may logically belong in one layout may ""depend"" (or at least appear to initially depend) on the position of views in other layouts, I've always found a way to use individually ConstraintLayouts to solve any layout issues I've come across. 

**""Fun"" Part?:** If you have a layout that you have found that you just CAN'T get working with ConstraintLayout, post it in here and we'll award internet points to whoever can solve it with ConstraintLayout. 

Hope this helps someone. ",1504026820.0,2017-08-29 17:13:40,33.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/androiddev/comments/6wl62g/constraintlayout_editor_lpt/
7764,Mountain Peaks Hiking App Idea?,"Hello all, 

This weekend I was climbing one of our highest mountain peaks and an idea popped in my head. 

Would you use an app which has these core functionalities:

1. Users share their climbed peaks

2. Users share list of their used equipment for each peak

3. Users share their routes

4. Users create groups for future hikes

5. Users could list all peaks and view information for them

6. Users could see and vote for shared equipments used for the selected peak shared by other users



My idea is based on creating a community which will share what equipment they used and what routes they took for each of their climbed peaks. Other users could see all of this information and prepare better before go to unknown hikes.


Do you think that this kind of app could be useful? ",1504027246.0,2017-08-29 17:20:46,0.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/androiddev/comments/6wl7ru/mountain_peaks_hiking_app_idea/

7767,What has been your best experience in promoting your apps specifically for Android?,"I've been working at my current company for about 5 years now as an Android developer, and I've been doing just that: building Android apps. Lately, there's been concern that only a small percentage of our users come from Android, and I've been asked if I know how to better reach Android users (spoiler alert: I don't, except to get the attention of editors on Google Play). Sites like Android Authority and Android Police are largely focused on hardware, and any attempts to reach out to the big blogs is largely unsuccessful (and I don't blame them; those sites are great because there isn't a lot of spam about apps and such). 

Overall, I'd simply attributed the lackluster Android growth to a lack of Android users in the early-adopter tech hipster demographic that seems to be hitting up the iOS app (probably thanks to being featured on Product Hunt a while back). 

Do you all have any favorite ways to reach out to the Android community? I feel like I should know this, but I've been so focused on software that the marketing knowledge just isn't up to snuff.

7780,Getting started with cross platform development.,"I'm trying to get stated with proper cross platform development for mobile.

I have successfully uploaded my first app to the Play, iTunes and Windows stores. I used Apache Cordova and jQuery 1.8. The app works to the client's satisfaction but it looks horrible and looks nothing like a native app. On top of that the code is a mess.

I decided that for my next project I'd do this ""properly"". Use a loader like webpack, and framework like React. Probably a LESS library like bootstrap, but i gotta use Ionic for a native feel right? Is Ionic installed INTO Cordova? Or does Ionic bundle Cordova already and then I heard about React Native vs Cordova and aren't they complementary? Wait there are alternatives for Ionic but are they for Cordova too? Does React Native not use Cordova? Should I still try to get jQuery? Or lodash? is lodash even necessary?

ARG!! I'm jumping from framework to framework seemingly at random.

My question is, what is the ""proper"" order I should setup these tools so I can even compare them?",1504063562.0,2017-08-30 03:26:02,1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/androiddev/comments/6wp0lr/getting_started_with_cross_platform_development/

7793,"How not to violate the Store policy of not mentioning another app, when you created a utility for another app?","[Added] Thank you for giving me advice. With your advice, now my app is accepted and published. I hope this post would help future developers who would encounter similar problems.

----

I have created a utility for a famous app, and it was obviously NOT trying to impersonate the app or pretend it was made by the famous company. I even added ""This app is not endorsed by [the company name]"" at the beginning of the description. It was rejected twice for impersonation. (It was accepted when I changed the name to some indirect description.)

Now, I created a utility for FireFox. This time, I did not even dare to include ""Mozilla"" as in ""This app is not affiliated with the Mozilla Foundation."" in the app's description. The app's name had nothing to do with FireFox, and in the description I did not call the browser ""FireFox"". Instead, I tried to be a little bit creative and called it ""the Fiery Foxy browser"", and used ""Foxy"" afterwards. After a few hours of submission, it was rejected for mentioning another app ""Foxy browser"". I thought, ""wow, either the human reviewer is working really hard or the A.I. reviewing software is really smart enough to figure out FireFox from that."" After a while, I thought ""wait... is there an app with that name?""

Yeah... unfortunately, there did exist an obscure app named ""Foxy Browser"". Anyways, this policy seems a little too strict. When the app is some kind of utility for some specific app, and when it is very obvious to humans that it is not affiliated with the app, shouldn't it be allowed to mention the name of the app, at least with some provisos, such as that you specify the store URL of the other app you mention in your description, and some fixed message such as ""This app is not endorsed by [the app's company]"" is automatically added to the app's listing? How are the developers supposed to write the description when they created utility apps for other apps? How do you handle this problem?

By the way, one thing that was weird is that when I searched the Store with ""FireFox"", I could see some third-party apps that had ""FireFox"" downright in the app's name. Such as ""XXX for FireFox"". How did they pass the store policy?


------------

After resubmitting the app by editing the description to call the browser just by ""fox"", it was rejected again and now removed for ""deceptive behaviour"". I really am not sure why it was thought to be ""deceptive"". The app clearly did not do anything deceptive, it does not have adverts, it does not require ANY permissions, and the description clearly described what it does. If I resubmit the app, they say they might suspend my developer account.

Below is the e-mail from Google.

""After review, APP_NAME, has been suspended and removed from Google Play as a policy strike because it violates the deceptive behavior policy.

Next Steps

Review the Deceptive Behavior policy for more details and examples of policy violations. Make sure your app title and/or description doesn’t misrepresent the function of the app.
Remember your app must comply with all policies listed in the Developer Program Policies and additional enforcement could occur if there are further policy issues with your apps.
Sign in to your Developer Console and submit the policy compliant app using a new package name and a new app name.
Additional suspensions of any nature may result in the termination of your developer account, and investigation and possible termination of related Google accounts. If your account is terminated, payments will cease and Google may recover the proceeds of any past sales and/or the cost of any associated fees (such as chargebacks and transaction fees) from you.

If you’ve reviewed the policy and feel this suspension may have been in error, please reach out to our policy support team. One of my colleagues will get back to you within 2 business days.""

-------------
I had submitted an appeal, and got Google's response, which is the following:

""We’ve accepted your appeal and your app, APP_NAME (APP_PACKAGE_NAME), has been conditionally reinstated.

Before submitting your app again, please make adjustments to your app’s title to avoid confusion about your app’s purpose.

Your app’s title is in violation of the Misleading Claims policy. Our policy states:

We don’t allow apps that contain false or misleading information or claims, including in the description, title, icon, and screenshots. Apps that advertise a certain functionality in their title must provide the user with that functionality.
As an example, an app titled ‘Mosquito Repellent’ must repel mosquitoes. If the app is intended to be a joke, prank, or guide, it must be clearly stated in the app’s title.

To prevent your app from being rejected again, please fix all violations before submitting your app for review. You may want to review the Developer Program Policies for additional policy guidance.

Please let me know if you have any other questions or concerns.""

In the dashboard, the app is displayed as ""Removed"" with a red - sign. All right, I will retry with another name, but the problem is that I think the previous title was not misleading, and I still am not sure what names will violate the rules again. I wonder if that person will reply if I actually ask him ""Is this new name ""XXXXXX"" acceptable?"" He did add ""Please let me know... questions"".

---

I had resubmitted the app and it is now accepted and published! I had renamed the app to something like 'XXX for FireFox"" and freely used the word ""FireFox"" in the descriptions (both the short and the full). So, unless Google is inconsistent, it seems that you can mention another app's name if your app's title has the "" for APP"" suffix.

Now that this is fixed, I am thinking about changing the name and descriptions of my aforementioned previous app. Its original title was like ""Adobe Reader Helper"" (it was not actually Adobe Reader; I named it so just for illustration purposes.), and its descriptions contained ""Adobe Reader"". It was first rejected for the title, so I renamed it to something like ""Helper for Reader"" (I feared if I use the company name it might be rejected. Notice how without the company's name that app's name loses its uniqueness.), but then it was rejected for the second time for having ""Adobe Reader"" in the descriptions. So I removed that word with some vague indirect words. So, the second rejection was only because I had ""for Reader"" and ""Adobe Reader"" in the descriptions and those two did not match verbatim? Now, I am going to test if I can add the company's name in my previous app's title like ""Helper for Adobe Reader"", and if it gets accepted, I will test if then I can use ""Adobe Reader"" in the descriptions.",1504089230.0,2017-08-30 10:33:50,6.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/androiddev/comments/6wqr8c/how_not_to_violate_the_store_policy_of_not/

7826,Some questions about developer account suspension.,"My previous post about my app being suspended for ""deceptive behaviour"": https://redd.it/6wqr8c

In short, I uploaded a new app, and Google said I got a policy strike for ""deceptive behaviour"". It turned out, it only was some simple misunderstanding of app naming rules, not that my app was malicious or I tried to deceive users. Google accepted my appeal and ""conditionally"" reinstated the app. I changed the app's name and descriptions, and now it was accepted.

During that process, I have learnt quite a lot of things, like

* You can get a policy strike without a prior warning, even if you did not have malicious intentions, and even for a newly submitted app (no users are affected).
* Only two strikes and you (not the account) will be banned for life.
* All related Google accounts (not only the account that received the strikes) will be deleted.

I thought only those bad app developers who intentionally steal user data or make virus apps would be banned for life. But no, any uncareful developers could be.

I have found this article from the web: https://datajhonpri.blogspot.com/2017/07/google-play-account-termination-what-now.html?m=1

According to that article, the author suggests creating a new account once you get one policy strike. My first question is ""wouldn't Google know that your new account is owned by the same person who got the strike, and if you get just one policy strike on the new account, both of the accounts will be banned?""

My second question is whether my incident above was recorded as strike 1 or not. They said that they ""conditionally"" reinstated my app, not that they were totally wrong, so if that was recorded as a strike 1, just another strike from my such a simple mistake could terminate my  account. 

Also, I would like to hear some of your stories if you ever unintentionally got a policy strike, so that I could try to avoid making such actions. I mean, not something like you got a policy strike because you stole user data, but something like you did not understand the policy correctly or made a mistake.

I don't want to end up having to program some of my classes/activities in Java and mix-and-match. Secondly, I just want to probe the current state of Kotlin on Android. Are things relatively smooth?

7829,Monetizing an app with Kiip: Why hasn't this caught on?,"Hi everyone!  I asked about this in one of the game dev forums, but wanted to check with non-game devs to get your thoughts.  I've been wondering about the Kiip platform, and if any devs have had success with it, or any thoughts about it. It seems like a great concept, rewarding players with real-life incentives like coupons, promotions, and free stuff. However, I haven't seen it integrated in any major engines or IDEs like traditional ad networks. I know it was in Game Salad for a minute, but was discontinued. When I heard about it a few years ago, it seemed like it was going to be the next big step in monetization.

For those who might not have heard of it, the idea is that instead of showing ads, you can give the player/user branded rewards at key moments. So if you have a fitness app that tracks miles walked, then if users meet a 10 mile goal, they get a coupon for a free Dasani water or something, ideally relevant to the app purpose.

I'm just wondering, is there a compelling reason why it hasn't seemed to catch on? I have a hard time even finding info about any games or apps that use it, other than a homework app I found. The lack of info, and the seeming lack of integration seem like some significant red flags.

Does anyone have experience with it or any insight as to why it might not have caught on, or maybe it is, but I just am missing it?

7891,Android Devs: How do you like to get type specs from your designers?,"I'm a visual designer working on a mobile app for the first time and am closing up the first phase of design. I designed the app for iOS first and then altered my designs for Android (changing screen size, switching out Apples San Francisco typeface for Roboto, etc.)

As I am putting together a handoff for my developers, I'm having a hard time figuring out the best way to set type. I know that size is defined as ""sp"" in android, but digging around on the internet hasn't given me any good answers on the best way to convert it. Most of the responses I've seen have just been to give my devs the design comps and my Sketch file and they will figure it out from there. This seems like a lot of extra work on the devs part and like it would create more room for error. 

Is this really the best way? What is most helpful to you when a designer is handing off their files?",1504384839.0,2017-09-02 20:40:39,1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/androiddev/comments/6xhbzf/android_devs_how_do_you_like_to_get_type_specs/

It's like a 20"" tablet running android, but we don't want the complete android experience. Instead the OS boots into an app we've made so the app is the only thing accessible on this tablet. The app is used to control some digital and PWM IO and streaming youtube vids.

Now how would I go about creating this? I've been searching for a while and I think I need to learn more about what terms to look for.

I want to keep unit prices as low as possible so it would be nice to use some android hardware off the shelf. If we were to make our own hardware what is the process for this?

7933,Getting to #1 of our search term in 2 weeks,"For those with new apps/games with low downloads, I'd like to share how we got our game to the top of the Play Store for our search term in around two weeks.

We did two things. Hit ~200 downloads in 1.5 weeks, and made as many backlinks to our page as possible within that period. All with $0 paid. The main things we did:

* **Feedback threads** Not spam advertising, but simply asking for feedback from other game designers app devs. 
* **Quora** There are a lot of threads on Quora were you are encouraged to post your game. We got about ~90 downloads from doing this.
* **Twitter** Created a twitter, made a tweet with a link to our game, and another one with gameplay footage. Then, networked and followed as many people as possible from our domain.
* **Kept rating high** I believe currently our game is rated 4.9/5.0 We were stuck at 5.0 for a while, which I was worried didn't look organic. Ironically, I think it looked worse with 5.0 than 4.9

This is pretty much it. Posted it in a couple IRC channels but I don't think that turned up anything.

**Mostly posting this to encourage those that are struggling with Play Store search ranking.** It is possible to become #1 for your search term in a short time period. We were very discouraged in our first week as our app wasn't on the list. Now you can simply find it by searching ""Brain Blocks"" in the play store.

I want to commission a programming team to write a program for USA Samsung phones, and I want to restrict the Bluetooth hopping to a specific range of channels, e.g. channels 1-4 and channels 75-79.

My concern is whether restricting Bluetooth hopping is really feasible from a cost and mechanical standpoint.

I would appreciate feedback from the experts in this Androiddev forum about their experience of doing so.  

It would be great if you could provide links to some examples.

Obviously we could divide the RFCOMM channels and assign unique UUIDS, to work on a separate thread.  

Or we could broadcast using socket id, io.

We have even been looking at using tv channels using EPG data.

Of course we would prefer to stay within the Bluetooth stack.  :)

Kept seeing 
&gt; Skipped X frames!  The application may be doing too much work on its main thread. 

The UI lagged like crazy. Swiping through a FragmentStatePagerAdapter was horrible and every few minutes I would get:
&gt; signal 6 (SIGABRT), code -6 (SI_TKILL), fault addr

&gt; Abort message: 'Could not write wake signal to fd 78: Bad file descriptor' 

Even SwipeRefreshLayout animations stuttered. 

But after unplugging my phone from my PC and rebooting my Pixel, the app performed back as usual, 100% flawlessly with no lag and zero crashes.

7967,Compiling command line linux tools for android?,"I use linux and have some command line tools I use on my computer pretty often. For example 'file', to figure out what kind of file something is.

Recently I rooted my phone (Pixel running Nougat), so I've been wanting to mess around with compiling different stuff for it and just figuring out how android works in comparison to linux. I wanted to add some of the common linux tools I use so I can use them from my phone when I don't have my computer. I tried to compile file, which seemed to compile fine, but it won't run and I don't understand the error it gives me:

---

So, this is the process I went through:
1. I used `apt-get source file` to get the source code for file.

2. I extracted `file_5.30.orig.tar.xz`

3. I had already downloaded the ndk: `android-ndk-r15c`

4. Then I found [this](https://gist.github.com/nddrylliog/4688209)  link for compiling autotools projects for android using the ndk.

5. I changed some options around in that script to what I thought fit my phone and version of android:
  * set CROSS_COMPILE to aarch64-linux-android and set the path to it
  * set SYSROOT to `/platforms/android-24/arch-arm64`
  * set other relevant paths to fit those choices

6. I ran that script instead of ./configure in the directory for file and did make and make install, which ran smoothly.

7. So, that gave me a directory with the binary and libraries.

8. I copied the binary `file` to `/system/bin/` and gave it permissions and ownership to match other executables there.

9. I put all the libs: libmagic.so, etc in `/system/lib/` and set thier permissions and ownerships to match the other libs.

10. Then I put magic.mgc in `/system/usr/share/misc/`

---

The problem is when I try to run it from the shell as a normal user I get this error message:
`""file"": error: only position independent executables (PIE) are supported.`

So, can anyone help me figure out what I'm doing wrong? 
Where can I learn more about correctly compiling autotools based projects for android?
If I were to compile it with static libs, would it be easier and how would I do that?

8008,My app usage - Oreo already at 0.6% over 20k users total,"With 20k users this is the OS usage I am seeing as of today per the Google Play Store.

    8.0   0.6%  (Oreo)
    7.x  73.7%  (Nougat)
    6.0  18.4%  (Marshmallow)
    5.x   5.2%  (Lollipop)
    4.4   2.0%  (Kitkat)

4.4 (19) is the lowest SDK level I support. These are not tech savvy folks so all the Oreo reporting must be Pixel devices which show up 7th and 10th place of top device models. Top 6 devices are Samsung based then Pixel, Moto Z, G5 and Pixel XL rounding out the top ten (according to Flurry).

Those numbers are quite a bit different than stats shown by the current Google Dashboard for overall Play Store usage. Not a big surprise there, this app (niche product, must be one of our users, login required, no need to post link here, e-commerce based with order processing including credit card payment processing).

App is fully written in Kotlin and has 99%+ crash free sessions according to both Google and Flurry. Trying to remove a few rare stragglers with the release that went out today. New release targets Oreo in build system but is not using any special Oreo features.

Supporting min 19 is not hurting me so I will leave it at that point for the near term future unless I see that count drop off even more.",1504716763.0,2017-09-06 16:52:43,28.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/androiddev/comments/6y9d1s/my_app_usage_oreo_already_at_06_over_20k_users/

8011,What static code analyzers do you run and when?,"There are a bunch of static code analyzers available:

* lint
* findBugs
* findSecurityBugs
* PMD
* Infer
* Error Prone

(If I'm missing any let me know)

But I've heard some are valuable and some not so much. Some you want to run on your CI on every PR, some on every commit, etc.

So what do you do at your company?

I currently (sadly) only have Checkstyle running on every PR, but I think that it's not really that helpful. Seems to cause more trouble than it helps. I believe jake wharton also mentioned somewhere that he didn't use it, but I think someone from FB said they used it.

For someone that's on a 4 person team, and we want to catch issues fast, but we also want the feel of a company that's been around for some time. How should we set up our CI for static analyzers?

8034,My first (not so useful) app using Kotlin and Realm,"So, one of my goals for the summer was to learn Kotlin. I started this project to learn Kotlin, Realm, Rx and to practice in general and this app turned out to be something that I am really proud of, even though the application itself isn't really good for anything. 
I encountered (SO) many problems and sometimes I felt like I never want to open Android Studio again. But now that I finished it (or at least I kind of feel like I did), I am really happy that I did open it up again and again. 
I wrote this app by myself (and with the help of tons of Google searches and this subreddit), I never had anyone I could discuss anything related to Android development. And I guess this is the reason I am writing now. 
I have no idea if there is something I shouldn't have done, should have done totally differently, used something no one uses, etc...
Now that I am finished, I feel kind of lost. I would like to ask your advice, opinion that could help me learn and improve the code and myself eventually.

8036,"Writing app for Andoid Tablet for my younger brother, urgently, money involved","Hey fellow redditors. My brother has a hard time writing with his tablet, he's an autistic boy and needs help where it's due. Holding (not guiding) his arm to tap a button, things like that („Facilitated Communication"", Wiki; https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Facilitated_communication). 
So I had the idea to ask Devs to develop an App for Android which can do two basic things: showing a usable keyboard to write + an area to read the written text (if possible continuous in two lines ), and a storing capability to save texts for later. 
I'll add two pics of the current device which is just a bit overpriced for my liking. 
First pic: (Imgur pic; https://imgur.com/a/K5a3G )
the keyboard to write and the window the show the written, but in just one line which is not helping cause the text is now continuing to the right hand side .. i.e. bullshit
second pic (Imgur; https://imgur.com/a/MxxDa )
theres a grid above the screen to helping to point more precise. It'd be great to have a grid as well, NOT IMPORTANT for the dev. just for me ... I'll search for that later. 
There's a bit of money involved. You can install a backdoor or something, like a test version if you like :)

 I understand every company is different and there is no way for you to predict what I'm going to be doing. All I ask is people's advice based on their own experience so I can get an inkling of what is going on behind the scenes and maybe prepare and study on stuff that I'm not familiar with.

8078,"Discussion about Clean architecture and relationships between presenters, views and use cases","I have some thoughts about MVP and Clean architecture, so I want to make the discussion here since it would too long for Q&amp;A thread.



  Let's assume that we have user requirements like this:


&gt;The user can get a list of newspapers. Newspapers can be free and paid. The user can download, buy and read newspapers. Client wants to have data saved in local database so user can always have some data even without Internet connection

So, we have identified following use cases:

* GetAllNewspapers
* ReadNewspaper
* DownloadNewspaper
* BuyNewspaper


**IMPORANT**: You can notice that I haven't listed SaveNewspaper use case since the user does not have the option to save data, it happens automatically without user knowledge.


We have one screen where we are presenting a list of newspapers and another screen where a user can read a newspaper. 


Purpose of presenters is to serve data to the user from use cases/interactors or to send data to interactors from UI.


Use cases should be abstract and clean of any external frameworks like databases, API's and UI.


Questions are:

* Should we have 1 on 1 relationship between presenter and views or one view can have multiple presenters?

* What relationship should be between presenters and use cases?

* Should I have SaveNewspaper use case even it is not use cases that user can do manually inside the app? Or I should just have some controller/wrapper for saving it in a database inside GetAllNewspaper use case.

8087,Another app is BREAKING my own?,"The company I develop for has paying subscribers calling up claiming the application ""used to work"" and then are saying ""nothing happens"" when they launch the app.

I have tested and perfected this app to no end. It works (and runs well) on Android 4.0.3 up to Android 8.0, and I have tested it on nearly every version in between using the Android Emulator.

I have been an Android developer for quite a while now — I thought I have seen it all, but this just baffles me. People have found a countless number of new phones and proprietary versions of Android to break our app on, but my sophisticated logging system tell me exactly how it happened, and what exception it threw &amp; where.

Now there's this:

We have people using our app on devices like the Samsung Galaxy S8+ and the Google Pixel XL. My logging mechanism gives me enough evidence to know they are navigating around our app and using it as expected... but there are also customers using the SAME phone and SAME version of our app using the SAME version of Android telling us it doesn't work at all.

(AFAIK, our app isn't even making it to the onCreate() method of the main activity, our logging would tell us)

HOW!?

There is nothing I can possibly do to help these people experiencing the issues they are having, and these one star reviews &amp; upset phone calls are absolutely wrecking me right now. Some of these people are extremely valued customers, and I don't mind spending hours on end to deliver them a quality app, but something really doesn't want me to.

Could there be another app installed on their phone that is conflicting with ours?

Is it even remotely possible that another app from the Google Play store can be killing our app as soon as it launches? A system cleaning tool?

I've read that storing data/methods in Application can cause issues when it's killed off, and storing Context related info in a Singleton can cause memory leaks, so I was curious what is the better design here.

8091,Confused whether I can legally use the Spotify Play widget button,"Hey guys. I've started working on a project which will be free to use, however there will be a subscription which will give users more features (none of the features will be related to Spotify). This means that the Play button will appear on both 'sides' (free and subscription) parts of the website.

According to the terms of use ([here](https://developer.spotify.com/technologies/widgets/terms-of-use/#section-ii-definitions)) under Section IV: Restrictions, widget restrictions ""e. Please note that the Spotify Play Button may not be used for commercial purposes. This restriction does not prohibit you from embedding the Spotify Play Button on Websites that contain advertising."" Unless this is talking about monetizing the button itself, and that being the sole reason of monetization? According to [this pdf](https://developer.spotify.com/developer-terms-of-use/faq/) you CAN charge money if the widget is not the standalone product.

So my question is whether I'm allowed to insert that play button (while complying with all the other dev rules of Spotify), and still monitize my website?

I'm in the UK.

Cheers for any answers!

8109,REST Api when your company has an internal client/tool and external apps?,"So I just started working for this new company and they had an internal tool/client application so that our customer service can update things through a nice interface.

Then a few years later (now) they apparently wanted apps for our customers so they exposed this api to some newly hired front end developers. Seems great because we have access to a pre-existing, tested api. There seems to be a lot of common calls, but then again theres way more calls that are not in common. This introduces some issues now when they want to change the output of some calls, they don't know which calls the clients are using exactly. So the clients proposed a split of the api. One for the internal tool and one for all of the outward/customer facing apps.

Seemed like a good plan, but the backend devs say that they can't maintain two apis, that they need to create one api, and the client app devs need to know which apis to use and tell the backend which apis we use. What's the thought on this?

Does your company reuse it's internal api for it's external apps? 

internal = the tool our customer service department uses
external = not really external as in third party developers, but external as in customer facing client applications (this is what I use since I'm an android dev there)",1504979260.0,2017-09-09 17:47:40,8.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/androiddev/comments/6yvkyu/rest_api_when_your_company_has_an_internal/

I'm currently working on a project that has an Android app that can connect to a Google App Engine server, but currently their two logs are completely separate. I was wondering what the best practice is for how to manage both logs. Should I create a route that allows the Android app to communicate to App Engine where it'll then log it there as well, or should I use a completely different service all together and keep them as distinct as possible?

8129,"Efficiently Populating RecyclerView with 50,000 SQLite DB Entries","To start with, yes I realize that it doesn't make a lot of sense to do this because a user obviously cannot scroll through 50,000 items. But I cannot find a better way to achieve what I want.

Which is to be able to use an EditText field to filter a RecyclerView (with the 50,000 items) in real time.

Querying the DB is quick, it's the parsing of the Cursor that is slow.

     public static ArrayList&lt;Game&gt; GetGamesForBrowse(Context context) {
            SQLiteDatabase db = DatabaseHelper.GetInstance(context).getReadableDatabase();
            ArrayList&lt;Game&gt; Games;
    
            Cursor cursor = db.rawQuery(""SELECT GamesDBID, GameTitle, Genres, ReleaseDate, PlatformName, BoxArtFrontThumb FROM Game ORDER BY GameTitle ASC"", null);
    
            Games = parseGamesListCursor(cursor);
    
            return Games;
        }

And the parsing:

      private static ArrayList&lt;Game&gt; parseGamesListCursor(Cursor cursor) {
            ArrayList&lt;Game&gt; games = new ArrayList&lt;&gt;();
            Game g;
            GameImage gi;
    
            try {
                while (cursor.moveToNext()) {
                    g = new Game();
                    g.setGamesDBID(cursor.getInt(0));
                    g.setGameTitle(cursor.getString(1));
                    g.setGenres(Utils.StringToList(cursor.getString(2)));
                    g.setReleaseDate(cursor.getString(3));
                    g.setPlatform(cursor.getString(4));
    
                    gi = new GameImage();
                    gi.Thumb = cursor.getString(5);
                    g.setBoxArtFront(gi);
    
                    games.add(g);
                }
            } finally {
                cursor.close();
            }
    
            return games;
        }

Once the data is fully loaded to a list, the EditText &gt; filter RecyclerView works great. It's the 10 seconds to load the data that is what I need to address.

I've tried to reduce the data I'm parsing to a single int, but that still creates a delay of a couple seconds. And I have a nice phone, so I know it would be painful on older phones.

Anybody have any suggestions as to how I can better approach this?

Thanks!

8137,Architecture Questions,"I've been looking into different Android architecture paradigms lately and hoping I could get some clarifications. Personally I haven't worked with formal architectures at all, so I'm looking at something I could adopt that makes sense to me. Primarily because I want to be able to make decisions based on formal guidelines and logical reasoning, as opposed to ""this feels good"". Plus, if I'm working on a team, everyone should be able to make architecture decisions on their own, and not end up doing things differently. Also it should be easy to understand, as in, I shouldn't have to sit there wondering how to fit a solution into this architecture, it should be obvious.

&amp;nbsp;

The goal of any architecture I believe is to write _high quality_ code. As in, if you follow the architecture guidelines properly, your code should be testable, maintainable, extendable, readable, etc. This stuff: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_system_quality_attributes

&amp;nbsp;

From what I've seen there seem to be a few general guidelines that formal architectures adhere to.

1) __Implementation details should be abstracted.__ So, for example when doing a network request, I wouldn't know that it's using Retrofit or some other library. The implementation details could be changed and this code should not change.

2) __Code should be organized by feature.__ I've seen some debate on this, but this seems to be the general consensus.

3) __Distinct logical layers should be separated.__ This depends what you consider to be its own layer, but it seems like the layers are usually implied in the architecture's name. Like MVP, MVC, MVVM, MVI, etc.

&amp;nbsp;

If I missed anything please let me know, I'm just trying to learn here.

&amp;nbsp;

There's 2 main things I'm wondering about:

1) How do you break up other layers in your code? Maybe this depends on the architecture, but I haven't seen much about this in any of them I've looked at. For example, what if you have a Service that gets too big, or a BroadcastReceiver, or you network parsing code, etc.? Are there formal solutions for this? I'm not looking for ""use this library"", more so the high level concept of how to break the code up.

&amp;nbsp;

2) Similar to my first question, how do you break up the defined layers of the architecture further? For example, MVP. What if my presenter becomes unmanageably large? Do I make sub-presenters, do I break that Presenter into multiple Presenters, some other solution? I have the same concern about the View layer, or any layer from any architecture really.

&amp;nbsp;

Any info is appreciated, links to suggested reading, specific architectures that might suit me, etc. Thanks!",1505061162.0,2017-09-10 16:32:42,9.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/androiddev/comments/6z1pxg/architecture_questions/

8150,Easiest Way to Create Flexible Webview App,"Hello.

I'm a website development and design student at Full Sail University. I don't know a whole heck of a lot about developing native apps, but I personally have been developing a web-based point of sale software that is nearly complete.

I want to be able to run this POS software via a full-screen kiosk webview. But there's a catch: I need to be able to open another app from within my webview using Android intent:// links.

Allow me to tell you what I've tried:

-MIT App Inventor: This worked great for basic functionality, but whenever I tried opening the external app with an intent:// URL, the webview threw and error saying the page didn't exist or was moved or whatever.

-Full screen kiosk apps: It seems like these apps either have one feature or another, not both. I want all navigation (popup windows included) to be handled within this webview, and I need to be able to open the intent:// URLs. But these apps either do one or the other, and not both.

Let me give you a full description of what I'm looking for to give you a better idea.

1. I start ringing a customer up in my full-screen POS software.

2. I total the order and click a link to open Square Point of Sale opens so I can take payment.

3. Square Point of Sale closes and loads a callback URL in my webview (NOT in Chrome/the default browser).

That's basically what I'm picturing. Just not sure how to do it though. Any help would mean a lot.",1505107567.0,2017-09-11 05:26:07,0.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/androiddev/comments/6z5yb9/easiest_way_to_create_flexible_webview_app/

Hope this question fits on this sub. A couple days ago I created a production release of my first Android app. After waiting a day and a half and posting around a bit I got 0 installs. Ouch. So I figured, why not take out an ad campaign on facebook? The prospects seemed quite good and I figured I'd at least break even on the ad budget.

However, as the title mentions Facebook shows plenty of activity, but my Google Developer Console only shows 2 install events: both at 9PM, being uninstalled in under a minute. The last update time is ""1 hour ago"" and the Store page also only lists ""1-5"" installs.

So my questions is: What's going on here? Am I missing something? Am I doing something wrong? Or is my game really just *that* unpopular?",1505115628.0,2017-09-11 07:40:28,20.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/androiddev/comments/6z6gd5/facebook_ad_campaign_40k_reach_1k_actions_120/

8158,"Planning to build an event (Con) app, need some advice","I am planning to start working on an app for a convention I am part of the staff for.  What the app needs to do primarily is have a schedule of events, one which can pull its data from an Excel or even Google Docs spreadsheet in real time, so updates pushed to that spreadsheet will go to the app automatically.

Ideally, the long-term goal is to make the app work cross-platform for iOS, Android, and other OSes depending on demand, but for right now I want to work on the Android version as my proof of concept/demo.  For layout ideas, I really like the Dragon Con app, so I will probably use that as the basis for my design.

We are currently using Attendify for our app, but it is limited as far as design and layout are concerned, and the Android app has an issue where it puts a title bar at the top on some devices, which is not present at all on the iOS app or phones such as the Galaxy S7/S8.

The questions I have are as follows:

1.  What would be the most reliable method for pushing schedule updates to the app?
2.  What tools/apps should I look at for designing the graphical elements?
3.  What do I need to look for to avoid the title bar issue the current app has?",1505130228.0,2017-09-11 11:43:48,3.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/androiddev/comments/6z7c9r/planning_to_build_an_event_con_app_need_some/

i just started to learn android programming a couple months ago and the thing im most intimidated of, is the orientation change of the device.

For example, i watched a video, which explained, how ressources leak when you handle the orientation change wrongly.

I need some advice on what I should do to invest in myself, and how I could land a entry level job in the Bay Area.

I want to know if the animations are okay, if the loading times are acceptable and more generally what should I tweak before releasing to the app store. When the last year I published my first app here in /r/androiddev it was really useful to me and I hope to recieve again many useful advices.

8208,Is it possible to detour Google's payment solution to evade transaction fee?,"I am not a developer, but a marketer. This is my question.

I don't like transaction fee which takes 30% of the gross revenue. And as far as I know, you don't have to use Google's payment solution when you provide an app through non-Play store route.

For example, in Korea, there's group of mobile games that provided through a specific web page for games that use third party payment solution.

So my question is like this.

1. Is this kind of payment detouring common in Western market?

2. Can you give some examples application that detours payment system?

3. An app that didn't distributed through Play Store doesn't have to follow the store's policy, right?",1505261323.0,2017-09-13 00:08:43,0.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/androiddev/comments/6zjimw/is_it_possible_to_detour_googles_payment_solution/

8233,Google removed my game from Google Play by mistake,"Hello all, in last week I had released my 3rd game (Android/WebGL), I threat gamedev as a hobby, it doesn't bring me any income (just my games are too weak for it, I'm just 19), 1.5 day after my game release, in Saturday I got email from Google Play, with information, that my game ""has been suspended and removed from Google Play as a policy strike because it violates the impersonation policy. Your app is identical to an existing app on the Play Store."". I couldn't understand what I did wrong, my game was not copy of other game, I didn't found any game with the same name, got no idea, why it happens. At a point 3. Of an email from Google I had read:



""3.Sign in to your Developer Console and submit the policy compliant app using a new package name and a new app name."" I have thought, that I will just change my game name and all will be OK, but no. I couldn't get my downloads, rates, description of game back, Google without warning just removed my game from Google Play. I didn't want to release my game again, also I didn't feel like I did something wrong. On Google Play there are a lot of games/apps that got same names like other game/apps, have same gameplay, and Google don't see the problem. There are anime and other games, Google has no problem with it., so I had written to Google.



After 3 days (today) I had received e-mail, that say: ""We’ve accepted your appeal and your app, Stickman RPG - Idle Money Clicker (com.donislawdev.stickmanavoid), has been reinstated. "". Oh nice, so I didn't have to change anything ( I thought problem is with game name, so wait, if I didn't have to change anything, so nothing was wrong... My game was just removed by mistake (I think Google bot done it), so I got my game back, but my marketing I was doing has fail (people couldn't download game)...



I don't complain, but Google Bot suck, removed my game from Google Play for 3 days, also I didn't hear ""sorry for mistake"", it's just like ""Oh yeah, so You didn't steal game, OK, get back to Google Play"". I must also say that, Google Play support (Humans) are very good, my issue was fixed fast.
My Game name is : ""**Stickman RPG - Idle Money Clicker**"". From fun fact, the game is also on Amazon Store/Kongregate, and all was fine there.

Users on 4.x devices (Samsung only?) are getting segmentation faults suddenly when trying to load native NDK-built code. I did release some small updates, but nothing remotely related to any NDK work. The exact same APK finds and loads the JNI linked code fine on 5.x+, but on 4.x we get a ClassNotFoundException. I have tried rebuilding with the latest NDK, but these binaries haven't been touched in 18 months. Did something change with the SDK or the build system that would break JNI linking on 4.x only? Has anybody else seen this?  
  
edit: So wacky issue. I think the Android build system changed at some point and 4.x began to have issues with where I was initializing my native code (statically in the Application.class).

8262,Is the next big cliff will be NativeApps fade off vs PWAs?,"We had this conversation with my colleague when he presumed that Twitter Lite example will, in the coming years, be more and more followed by big Web companies and they will then drop their NativeApps support.

Today Progressive Web Apps can do more of the same as NativeApps (I'm not agree with this sentence, but this is how they are marketed to developers by Google Chrome team), with offline usage and access to 80% of the Android API. And plus, they are crossplatform (depending of the browser/view which runs them).

Another middle-road point can be: if webdev really don't want to learn Java/Kotlin, they can, at least, use solution like React Native instead of PWAs. But in final, it's all JavaScript again, even if they are transpiled to native Android &amp; iOS object.

For my colleague, the only point that refrains some Web companies to embrace fully PWAs is that iOS does not support PWAs very well, compare to Android.

To me, PWA can be a good solution when your ""NativeApp"" is just a wrapper to your website with some offline and notifications capabilities in bonus. For all other usage (Phone, Messaging, tools like File Manager, Music Player, Video Player, Games, Fitness...) I don't see NativeApps fade off, but maybe I'm wrong.

When I read r/androiddev, it's clear that you prefer NativeApps.
I personally prefer Native, but I'm not a webdev and I don't care about multiplatforming to iOS, so I'm a bit biaised for this analysis.

Do you think PWA will earn some part of the cake? Or do you believe that NativeApps (and InstantApps, as they are just NativeApps with minor changes from your existing apps) have a strong future?",1505385303.0,2017-09-14 10:35:03,16.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/androiddev/comments/6ztw10/is_the_next_big_cliff_will_be_nativeapps_fade_off/

8269,Clean Architecture and Sharing Code with iOS,"So the goal with Clean Architecture (CA) on Android is to separate most of your code so it's not dependant on Android. So in theory it could run outside of Android. But most Android developers use Java, so it would really still need to be in a Java environment. 

&amp;nbsp;

But I was wondering, if you're using an approach like CA doesn't it start to make sense to write these layers in native code? At least if you have an iOS version of your app. That way you could share this code easily. I've seen posts about companies like Dropbox doing this a few years ago: https://oleb.net/blog/2014/05/how-dropbox-uses-cplusplus-cross-platform-development/

&amp;nbsp;

Assuming you were proficient at writing native code, is this the natural next step? If you structured your apps appropriately, surely it would save a lot of time? You could still keep the platform specific things like design separate. Are there major pitfalls I'm not seeing?

&amp;nbsp;

One other thing - I'm no expert on Kotlin, but I've been learning Swift lately and it seems to be very similar to Kotlin. I also came upon this website that compares the syntax of the 2 languages, showing that they are nearly identical in a lot of ways: http://nilhcem.com/swift-is-like-kotlin/ If they are so similar, I wonder if you could devise a solution to automatically translate to one language. And then write this domain logic for example in Kotlin for both platforms. Then run some script to translate it to Swift.

&amp;nbsp;

At least for larger apps that support both platforms, which will be supported for many years, I wonder if this is the *best* approach? I never considered it before learning about CA, but knowing that none of the code you share is dependant on the platform makes sense to me. In fact, that seems like part of the purpose of the architecture - to reuse this code on different platforms.

&amp;nbsp;

I'm curious what people think of this, and if there's any trend with other large companies taking this approach?",1505392716.0,2017-09-14 12:38:36,8.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/androiddev/comments/6zufvv/clean_architecture_and_sharing_code_with_ios/

8280,Am I viable for an Android Development job? Details are in added text.,"Sorry for asking such a broad question, but I'm in a tight squeeze right now. Was prepared to start college this fall, but one week before the first day my father stated he no longer wanter to pay, and it was too late for a FAFSA application to help with covering tuition. To prevent accumulating too much student debt, I decided to defer and aggregate savings from work.

Now, enough of the sob-story and onto why this post is in /r/androiddev. In the last year I spent many hours self-teaching Android Development to create an opportunity for developing an application I've fantasized about for a while. The education included the following:

 * Taking [Java for Complete Beginners by Cave of Programming](http://courses.caveofprogramming.com/p/java-for-complete-beginners) 
 * Reading [Head First Java by O'Reilly](http://www.headfirstlabs.com/books/hfjava/)

 * Taking Udacity's [Android Basics Nanodegree by Google](https://www.udacity.com/course/android-basics-nanodegree-by-google--nd803) (without paying for the degree)

 * Taking Udacity's [Firebase in a Weekend: Android by Google](https://www.udacity.com/course/firebase-in-a-weekend-by-google-android--ud0352)

My question is: With that background, will employers see me as a viable Junior Android Developer candidate? Also, what else should be studied to make me more competitive, yet isn't expensive?

8281,"How is TV-WB ""Android TV does not support any web browsing content"" detected for Android TV approval?","I submitted my app for Android TV approval, and it was rejected due to the following eligibility issue:

&gt; Your app contains links to web content, however, Android TV does not support any web browsing content. Please refer to our documentation for details: http://developer.android.com/distribute/essentials/quality/tv.html#TV-WBFunctionality 

Has anyone else been rejected due to this error?  Does anyone know what test they use to trigger this error?  

My first thought is `new Intent(Intent.ACTION_VIEW, uri)`, however, since other apps can register an intent-filter on a uri, I can't see them flagging any uri.  

My second thought is maybe they scan the string resources for anything with ""http://"" in it (or any url that a TextView would automatically linkify)

&amp;nbsp;

My app does indeed contain links, but I specifically check to see if there's an Intent to open the URL, and if not, I show a DialogFragment with a QR code that the user can scan from their phone (example: https://i.imgur.com/mxi6wjC.png ).  I'm aware this isn't the prettiest solution, but for the limited times I show an URL, it's fine.

I explained this in their *Appeal an app rejection from Android TV* form, and the next day, I received the exact same templated rejection, with nothing to address what I said.  I assume a real human didn't read it, or a human that does not care.  I suspect I will have to create two apk's, one specifically for Android TV, and one for the rest. But first I need to guess how they are detecting links to web content, so that I can remove the offending code and pass their automated check.

This TV_WB test must be fairly new, as my app is a fork of another Android app, and that one was approved for the Android TV.

&amp;nbsp;


Any help or guesses on how they detect TV_WB would be appreciated.  

If you've had an Android TV app approved recently (within the last 6 months) and it had links to web content that were disabled on Android TV, I'd also appreciate knowing how you coded it to pass their test.",1505421965.0,2017-09-14 20:46:05,2.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/androiddev/comments/6zxk6p/how_is_tvwb_android_tv_does_not_support_any_web/

**EDIT 2 (9/15):** WOW 8 reviews on the playstore! Is this what fame feels like? Much thanks for feature requests, UI suggestions, and bug reports! What a great sub. I'm going to work at my service job right now but I'll get back to work on the app and responding to comments later.

I started learning Android development a little more than a year ago after starting to watch Udacity's tutorials. I had very little experience with programming before hand (some javascript with web dev). After a while of feeling like I wasn't *really* learning, I felt like I should just jump into it and start writing my own without guidance. 

With *some* background in knowing illustrator I made some designs for my app and started writing it back around February. I worked on this as a hobby between work and school, sometimes giving too much of my free time to it. But anyway, I'm proud to say that I saw the project through to the end. By the end of the project, I definitely feel like I have a better grasp on how programming really works, but still recognize I have a way to go with learning best practices like architecture. 

The app is a simple guide for making coffee using various methods. I put in custom icons and illustrations just to give it some flair. 

Below are links to the Github, Behance, and the playstore link. Any feedback or criticism is welcome. I'd like to include this on my resume/portfolio.

8327,Question about a group voice chat on Android,"Hey guys,
for a hobby project of mine im looking to implement a group voice chat function into my app.


I already got the microphone data in realtime and send them to my server which is running on C# with NAudio. Its working fine-ish but im not sure if this is the correct way to go.
Right now. Multithreaded UDP server with Android and IOs clients. Sending Raw PCM Byte Data from the clients to the server and the server is distributing.


I heard it might be better with using SIP though. Do you guys have experience there? I googled a bit but im not sure on how to setup a SIP server for example.

I read that SIP would be most likely the better solution for what I want to achieve.


Would SIP be much better than what I have? And any experience and how to use it? Especially server sided, I actually have no idea how to set it up. Also, does every user need a SIP account then?

8338,Recommended Augmented Reality Sdk?,"I'm working on a little experiment to visualize diagrams with AR on Android. 

First step would be to just project a flat png on a horizontal surface (e.g. table). That png should not be included in the app's asset folder, but loaded at runtime from the web.

Second step would be to load 3D .obj files dynamically from the web and put them on a surface. 

Third step would be to interact with the models by clicking them on the phone, but that's far away. 

I played around a little with [Google's new ARCore SDK](https://developers.google.com/ar/develop/java/getting-started) which looks promising but seems to be in a ""proof of concept"" stage (very limited API / capabilities). 

I also checked out [Vuforia](https://www.vuforia.com/), [Wikitude](https://www.wikitude.com/) and [Kudan](https://www.kudan.eu/), but to really get into one of these seems quite some investment (in terms of time), so I'd thought I'd ask you guys if any of you have experience with similar tasks and can line out the strengths and weaknesses of the AR Sdks you have experience with?",1505570273.0,2017-09-16 13:57:53,24.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/androiddev/comments/709i1e/recommended_augmented_reality_sdk/

But I sometimes get quite a few textviews or layouts I have to then bind in my activities/fragments.  

Let's say you are showing the user 5 things about their profile in a vertical list fashion, would you use a recyclerview or just 5 individual layouts arranged vertically in xml?

8370,Satisfying my engineering appetite,"I am not sure if this is the right place to put this post. Please let me know if it's not.

I've been an Android Developer for around 1 year 4 months now. 

Most of the friends that I've around work on the backend side. Their work mostly involves writing their own services or maintaining the infra. They are always talking about memory consumption of their services, applying multithreading to various parts of their service, the deployment lifecycles, increasing the req/sec ratio, trying out different databases and then comparing them.. etc, which all sound very interesting to me.

Whereas working on the android client, I feel like I am missing out on all those things which as a software engineer I should be knowing/have been doing by now. My work on android doesn't require me to go deep down on the memory/database layer or threads or networking layer. I feel like there's too much abstraction that android provides/there are too many libraries that writing code with them doesn't satisfy my hunger and I am afraid that keeping away from using core cs concepts in my code for a long time would make me forget all these concepts. 
There ARE some interesting engineering things to be done in the android client that we have, but most the time, I feel like I am just developing the screens as the product requires and doing nothing that I'd be proud of.
There are things like keeping it crash free but from an engineering perspective, what I am learning from a fact that we can't commit a fragment transaction after activity's state has been saved (just an example).


So, I wanted to ask fellow android developers that how do you satisfy this engineering appetite of yours? ",1505675185.0,2017-09-17 19:06:25,23.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/androiddev/comments/70hzpm/satisfying_my_engineering_appetite/

8417,Figuring out Architectures,"I've spent the past few weeks trying to understand how to properly create Android apps in the 'modern' way. I've read about and tried out [Google's MVVM](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture/guide.html), [Hannes Dorfmann's MVI](http://hannesdorfmann.com/android/mosby3-mvi-1), and also tried to come up with ideas of my own.
 
Eventually I realized it all seems to come down to the way the View interacts with the ViewModel (Presenter/Controller, whatever you like to call it) - further layers like network access, system APIs or persistence always end up looking more or less the same. The confusion is mostly about the direction of data flows between the View and ViewModel.
 
There are two things that need to be happening in an app: the View needs to deliver user Events to the ViewModel, and the ViewModel needs to deliver a ViewState to the View. (let's assume that the entire state of the View is represented by a single class, as that seems to be the accepted best practice) There are also two ways to do these things: expose an Observable (or LiveData) that the other class observes, or push the new data into the other class. This gives us a total of 4 different approaches that we could take. I've enumerated them below with the names I think they represent:
 
1\. Plain old MVP
 
* View pushes Events into ViewModel
* ViewModel pushes ViewState into View

2\. MVVM, with [example here](https://gist.github.com/gstepniewski/e12efdf3da660173b8f56b11ee8ab253)
 
 * View pushes Events into ViewModel
 * ViewModel exposes ViewState and View observes

3\. MVI, with [example here](https://gist.github.com/gstepniewski/1499ec600224a63fd714f4964c362364)
 
* View exposes Events and ViewModel observes
* ViewModel pushes ViewState into View

4\. The last option, let's just call it MVRx, with [example here](https://gist.github.com/gstepniewski/e8f8549792afbd198eef16377dac629a)

* View exposes Events and ViewModel observes
* ViewModel exposes ViewState and View observes

**Question time!**

Did I understand the rules and implement them correctly in my examples?

If yes, which one do you choose and why?

My feelings are:

 * MVP does not seem to accommodate Rx/LiveData easily, so I'd turn it down.
 * MVVM is nice, but having the View push Events to the ViewModel could easily lead to logic being contained in the View
 * MVI is also nice, but the problem is that your ViewModel gets a reference to the View which could cause leaks
 * MVRx solves the problem of MVVM, but not MVI (you still need a reference to the View)

I think I currently like MVI the most as it seems the cleanest - but I'd like to hear the opinions of some more experienced devs. Let me know what you think!",1505806513.0,2017-09-19 07:35:13,51.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/androiddev/comments/70tww6/figuring_out_architectures/

8420,Integrating streaming media in an app,"I'm interested to integrate streaming media in one of my apps (i.e. directly from an InputStream, without writing the file to the disk first), but I don't really know where to begin. Does anyone have any experience or opinion on this?

So far, I've come across following options:
* MediaPlayer: I'm not sure whether it's possible to read directly from InputStream
*MediaCodec: This seems to be the most low-level (i.e. complicated) option, I guess it would require a lot of tweaking
*Using ffmpeg or vlc and include it in the app: sounds like overkill, but I don't know...

The other three levels (750 puzzles in total) will be unlocked via a one-time in-app purchase which also removes the ads from the first level.  

I want to make money on this game, but I also want that in-app purchase to be an amount low enough that people don't even think twice about paying it if they've been enjoying the game so far and want harder challenges. 

Suggestions?

I'd especially like to know if you've debated this question with your own app, what you decided and how that worked out for you.

Thank you for your help!

Is it a complete different app developped on the side with Apple dev language/DB and all or there is a simple way to do it simultaneously to avoid surprises on the other end?

What do you recommend and why? I'm new to android development and can't decide between push notifications (e.g. Firebase) and socket.io.

Firebase looks very convenient, but sockets seem to be better for checking the online status. What do you think?

8503,I'm confused about Android O and task execution with exact alarms,"Not so long ago AlarmManager.setExactAndAllowWhileIdle() got introduced to be able to fire exact alarms even in Doze mode.

The common practice is when the alarm fires start an IntentService from onReceive() using WakefulBroadcastReceiver.startWakefulService(), do your stuff in the Service and call WakefulBroadcastReceiver.completeWakefulIntent() when finished to release the WakeLock.

In Android O **WakefulBroadcastReceiver is deprecated**.

How can we keep the same behaviour without using WakefulBroadcastReceiver?

The API docs suggest to use JobScheduler, but it does not support task execution at an exact time (or does it?).

**TL;DR**

How can we perform tasks in Android O at an exact time, even when Doze is active?",1505990314.0,2017-09-21 10:38:34,17.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/androiddev/comments/71arjj/im_confused_about_android_o_and_task_execution/

8515,What architecture pattern is this?,"I'm working on a project that is using ""mvp"" but I'm not sure if that's correct. What is being used? 

Here is the setup... 

Either an activity or fragment has a presenter injected. It also has a view injected. The view is not an android view, it's a pojo that contains all the logic that the fragment or activity would normally have as a view in mvp. This allows view logic to easily be moved to activity/fragment/customview/dialog. 

The view is as dumb as possible. It exposes user events through observables and allows data to be set through methods. This is all exposed through an interface. The view has no reference to the presenter. 

The presenter is given the views interface in its bind method. It observes the views observables and sets data through the interface. The presenter interacts with models/interactors as you'd expect. 

What architecture is this? It's different from the mvp and the mvvm I see online.

8516,Can I release this app without losing money?,"Hello!

I have created an app which uses Google's Cloud Vision API. It allows the user to select one of 3 modes, ""Thing"" detection, Logo detecion and Landmark detection. The user can then take a photo with his device and then 
retrieve 

**1. ""Thing"" detection**
The user retrieves the name of the thing he photographed along with a description about the item from Wikipedia. The user can also click ""learn more"" to go to the wikipedia article about the thing. Example: ""Musical Instrument"", or ""Hand"". 

**2. Logo detection**
The user retrieves the name of the company he photographed a logo of along with a description about the company from Wikipedia. The user can also click ""learn more"" to go to the wikipedia article about the company. Example ""Google"" or ""Pepsi"".

**3. Landmark detection**
The user retrieves the name of the landmark he photographed along with a description about the landmark from Wikipedia. The user can also click ""learn more"" to go to the wikipedia article about the landmark. Example ""Eiffel Tower"" or ""White house"".

However, every 1000 query to the cloud vision API will cost me 1.5 usd. I would love to share my app with the world, but hopefully without it costing me alot of money. The cloud vision API from Google is really cool, and I reccommend you to try it out! So my question is, is there any way I can release this app without going broke? I figured I could implement a required ad to show after every x amount of queries the user send, but I am hesitant to overload the users with ads. I heard that every 1000 view of an ad generates about 2 usd income, so its probably not going to add up either?

Anyhow it was a fun experience developing the app and getting it to work, but I am just curious if you guys had any thoughts about it?",1506018396.0,2017-09-21 18:26:36,5.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/androiddev/comments/71dn0l/can_i_release_this_app_without_losing_money/

8518,Which Kotlin testing framework to use,"I haven't been using kotlin for around 6 months and recently I have started writing a side project in kotlin. I can't really figure out which framework to use. 

On previous projects I have used a combination of 

* Junit
* [mockito-kotlin](https://github.com/nhaarman/mockito-kotlin)
* AssertJ

I tried to use this combination again and I seem to be running into problems with mockito-kotlin so I want to explore the alternatives. Further more I assume the language can offer a nicer way of testing.


I knew about spek before. Although I understand the benefits it proposes, it seems somewhat convoluted (this is more than likely due to me having a java/junit mindset).


It does appeal to me as it is made by jetbrains. But then I became unsure for a couple of reasons

* You have to use the [jack toolChain](http://spekframework.org/docs/latest/#_android) . I guess the docs might be out of date 
* [If you’re using the JUnit 4 runner, the plugin won’t work](http://spekframework.org/docs/latest/#ide-support)
* [The assertion frameworks don't seem to have much of a community or are  made by individuals](http://spekframework.org/docs/latest/#_assertion_framework)

The exception to the rule  is `org.jetbrains.kotlin:kotlin-test`but that doesn't have any documentation and I have to search in the kotlin repo to find it. 

So after all that I am left confused. Are you guys sticking to the typical java libs/methodologies of testing? Or have you switched to a kotlin style?",1506019503.0,2017-09-21 18:45:03,5.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/androiddev/comments/71drrq/which_kotlin_testing_framework_to_use/

Based on endles reading and trying I figured out that that I can retrive logs as soon as logcat viewer is connected to my phone. There are multiple viewers on available as discussed in stackoverflow- android desktop log viewer or do it only by the means of ADB (in conjuction with LineageOS bug report).

Furthermore I found good explanation aboute the log levels (https://www.xda-developers.com/guide-sending-a-logcat-to-help-debug-your-favorite-app/) and message types (https://stackoverflow.com/questions/14555268/android-log-main-events-radio-buffers).
But what do you do when you on the move with phone. I know there a plenty of apps. I used aLogcat root but it exported only a fraction of the live log, whyever?
mLogcat allowed me to save huge logs what began before I connected it to a desktop PC.
I cannot explain how that is possible sine any other viewer shows only live logs and may shows only a limited number of log entries.

So I would like to know how is the loging process started and how it is ended. Is there any command or does an logcat app need to run.

8575,How do I use MVP with Volley keeping the model layer unit testable?,"I am using Volley for making network requests. Currently, all of my code resides in activities and/or fragments. I am trying to refactor my code as per the MVP architecture. Now, the model should be responsible for making the network calls and other layers should not know how the network calls are being made. This means that all Volley class imports should be limited to my model layer. I also want to keep my model layer testable through  local unit tests (which is not possible if I have android imports in the model class). Since Volley is a part of android classes, importing Volley in the model layer implies importing android classes, which makes the model layer non-JVM testable. How do I refactor my code keeping these two constraints in mind ?

Project has 1 big module and 4 small modules and about 50 dependencies. There is around 90000 methods in total. MinSdk is 16.

I tried many tips and tried using Instant run but there was no lasting significant improvement. I am thinking about updating or buying new computer.

I have Acer Aspire E15 with i5-4210m cpu (2.6/3.2Ghz), ssd + hdd disk (Android studio is on ssd, project on hdd) and 8GB ram. Do you think updating ram to 16gb would help or is there problem with cpu? If so, should i get quadcode i7?

8578,Oreo and service vs jobscheduler,"Hello there fellow devs,

I'm bound to have some spare time in the weekend and I'm going to use it to rewrite from scratch an old application of mine. Let me broadly describe you what we're talking about in its current, very outdated version:

**What**

- Reads the sticky intent related to the *battery status* and processes it according to some business rules

- The resulting data is used to show stuff in a view, *as long as the app's mainactivity is on the foreground*

- The resulting data is also used to throw a notification under some circumstances, *regardless of the app's activity's status*

**When**

- *whenever the user plugs the device*, regardless of the main activity's status, until the device gets unplugged.

- *whenever the user brings the main activity to the foreground*, until the main activity goes in the background.

**How**

- A plain old *service* hosts a *timer* that repeats a *runnable* every second where most of the work happens.

- *BroadcastReceiver*(s) are used to spot when the device gets plugged/unplugged and fire off the service.

- The service is also fired off by the main activity's *onCreate*.

- Unrelated note, *BroadcastReceiver*(s) are also used to let the service communicate with the rest of the app (a-la EventBus).

**Conclusion**

I'll be rewriting the app with clean architecture + mvp + dependency injection, which is fine and I don't need help with. What I'm really not sure is *how to make this app fully Oreo-compliant*: as far as I understand it, my service (a background service by definition since it doesn't do any user-noticeable work) would not be guaranteed to run at all (it would run for about 10 minutes after the main activity exits the foreground, or after receiving the broadcast).

I considered using *JobScheduler* but the system is clearly designed for a very different scenario: relatively long workload that needs to be done in the background not necessarily immediately, under flexible conditions, and might be periodic but with a minimum of 15 minutes for the period.
I need to run a very lightweight workload that needs to be done in the background every second and, under rigid certain conditions, absolutely immediately.

**The questions**

- Would a sticky notification turn my service into a foreground one?

- Am I totally missing something about the JobScheduler?

- Is there a completely different alternative I'm not thinking of?

Thanks in advance and have a great one!

**Edit**: [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pumf_4yjTMc) episode of Android Developers provided a definitive answer to my first question, which kind of solves the whole problem. That said, I'd still be interested in alternatives!

I have not shared the Play Store link anywhere, neither have I told anyone about the app.

According to the statistics, 80% of the downloads came from the Netherlands, so surely it can't be bots that download apps to boost installation counts, right?

I published a new version with a different package name because I lost my keystore file &amp; that new version is the one being downloaded.

8628,Question for Android Developers from a CS student,"I would like to become an Android Developer in the future. Right now, I am in my final year of my Undergrad in Computer Science in Game Development, however I don't want to pursue a career in game development. I would like to become an android developer but I have no formal training in Android (eg. modules in school). I do have knowledge of Java. I have tried learning it on my own by following Nerd Ranch Guide, but can only make a simple application at the moment. I am willing to put in the effort to learn android development everyday on top of school work if necessary.

Here are some questions that I have:

	1. How did you get an android developer job? Did you have formal training in Android or did you self learn?
	2. I've seen some android developer job requirements. Some companies require you to show a portfolio of applications on the Google Play store. What if you do not have an application good enough to put on the app store? Will companies still accept you?
	3. Are there internship opportunities in android developer positions for fresh computer science graduates with not much knowledge in android development? (But willing to learn)
	4. Is there any courses for getting a formal android certification that's good enough for a job? 
	5. What's a typical day for an Android developer like? Is it a lot of coding? Meetings?

8641,"DocumentFile is dead slow, here's CachedDocumentFile to the rescue","DocumentFile used to access SAF content:// Uri in a convenient way is dead slow because most of its methods (getName, isFile, length, ...) make a query to the underlying ContentProvider:

&amp;nbsp;

https://github.com/android/platform_frameworks_support/tree/master/core-utils/java/android/support/v4/provider  
  
&amp;nbsp;
  
You may not notice it if you deal with a folder with just a few files, but with a moderate or large number of files, its slow performance will hit hard.
  
&amp;nbsp;
  
The turning point for me was this apparently benign code that sort folder's children in alphabetic order:

&amp;nbsp;

    DocumentFile folder = ...
    List&lt;DocumentFile&gt; files = Arrays.asList(folder.listFiles());    
    Collections.sort(files, new Comparator&lt;DocumentFile&gt;() {
		@Override
		public int compare(DocumentFile file1, DocumentFile file2) {
			return Collator.getInstance().compare(file1.getName(), file2.getName());
		}
	});

&amp;nbsp;
 
Remember each getName()  making a ContentProvider query per call ? 
Above code gets incredibly slower as there are more items to sort. Like taking 40s to sort 100 items.

&amp;nbsp;


DocumentFile being braindead, I made a CachedDocumentFile class  implementing DocumentFile and able to cache ContentProvider query data for any existing DocumentFile:


&amp;nbsp;

https://gist.github.com/bubbleguuum/55a6f27d97096583e79248e2e367a032

&amp;nbsp;

Due to the package protected default constructor of DocumentFile,  CachedDocumentFile needs to be in package android.support.v4.provider.

To use, simply wrap an existing DocumentFile:

    documentFile = ...
    documentFile = new CachedDocumentFile(documentFile);

By default, children returned by listFiles() are  CachedDocumentFile. You can change this with:

    documentFile = new CachedDocumentFile(documentFile, false);

Finally, to invalidate cached data: 

    documentFile.invalidate();",1506351015.0,2017-09-25 14:50:15,24.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/androiddev/comments/725ee3/documentfile_is_dead_slow_heres/

I want to develop a small 2d game that I designed and I'm wondering what tools should I use. 

I'm Android dev for quite long time but I haven't tried game development too much. I've got some experience with Unity but I wonder if there is any alternative to this. Does Unity 2D good job in such small indie games? As far as I remember I had some issues with CPU draining while developing using Unity.

I know most of indie devs create their own game engines, but I don't think I am skilled enough in computer graphics to do this.

What would you recommend? I've heard libgdx is quite fun to use, as far as I remember flappy bird used it.

8658,Does anyone here uses custom ViewGroups with &lt;merge&gt; elements ?,"My app has a bunch of custom composite Viewgroups as described there: http://lucasr.org/2014/05/12/custom-layouts-on-android/

Basically, they subclass a platform layout like LinearLayout and inflate a &lt;merge&gt; XML layout in their constructor to create the childs. 

It works well and all but I'm having a hard time with Android Studio because it doesn't recognize the root &lt;merge&gt; element and autocompletion/lint doesn't work, which is a bit painful when you start doing complex layouts.

I opened a bug some time ago there: https://issuetracker.google.com/issues/37150098. But it got little attention so I guess people use different strategies or no custom ViewGroups at all. 

Do I miss something ? What do you guys do to create reusable ViewGroups ?

I have an app made in android studio that is translated to Spanish and Russian. Some users have their phone set to Russian but still want to use the English version.

Has anyone done this before? Is it worth the struggle? There seem to be very few apps that let you change the language in the app settings but I can't be the first person trying to do it. I'm also wondering if there is an easier way. Is it, for example, possible to programmatically remove all the localization stuff in the app so that only the engilsh (default) language remains? I have not been able to find any ""simple"" way of doing it but it seems like such a simple problem to me.

8707,Making sure notifications are displayed,"Hey guys,

I am currently developing an app where the user can customize notifications to run on specific repetitions, from every day to e.g. 1.10 - 9.10, on every day except monday and saturday. 


To create the notifications at the date, I schedule a BroadcastReceiver with the AlarmManager, that gets called when the next notification is supposed to display. This Receiver then creates the actual notification and schedules the next Receiver, and so on.


This all works fine, but with this implementation, the problem is, that when one BroadcastReceiver isn't called, the chain stops, and no notifications are shown anymore. This is for example the case, when the smartphone is turned off.


How would you go about fixing this problem? Is there any other implementation that I missed for this whole thing, that works way better ?


Thanks in advance!

Recently I noticed that Dart and Google's Flutter SDK is gaining some traction and is becoming popular among devs. It uses Dart over JavaScript (Something which annoyed me when I first began using it(using it for the pass 3 months)).

8717,How are network requests handled in your company's Android app?,"In my company, we have a base SuccessResponse and ErrorResponse class. Every single API call response then subclasses the SuccessResponse and ErrorResponse. Then each activity implements the onSuccess and onFailure method of whatever controller is called.

As an example, say there is an API call to get the Users, there will be a GetUserSuccessResponse which subclasses a SuccessResponse and GetUserFailureResponse which does the same for the ErrorResponse. Where that call is made, the activity overrides onSuccess() and onFailure() then in onSuccess() for example, there will be a condition like

    if(response instanceOf GetUserSuccessResponse) 
    doSomething

Making my first large-ish project, and am having trouble dealing with multiple layouts. Currently I have 3 layout XML files, and I have some buttons that when called change the current layout, as well as running some other functions. I feel like this is wrong cause I have only one Mainactivity style Java file, and am stuffing all my UI based code in there. 

And when I think about navigating to a previous screen, now I'd have to make a button that is tied to a variable that keeps the previous XML layout is, and resets it. This all seems bad as I get further into this project

It's my first time working with many different layouts, and all of my googling seemed to lead me to fragments, but that seems like segmentations of the screen.

Basically, how should it be structured, how should I swap layouts, and assumedly this shouldn't be all in Mainactivity. 

My reading of the Android documentation wasnt all to helpful for me though it has been on past issues, so maybe I wasn't finding the right documentation.

Deploy a debug version of my app that can be run alongside the prod version with build variants. 



What I've done so far:

* Successfully changed the application label using [this approach](https://stackoverflow.com/a/36455983).
* Modified permissions in manifest to support either application label (more on that below)
* Successfully deployed both apps on the same device



Problem:

When accessing functionality in the app that requires a Google API such as Maps, the app crashes with the following: 

java.lang.SecurityException: Invalid API Key for package = com.xxx.xxx. Status code received = 12.



Question: 

Do I need to generate a new API key for the debug build? Also, I notice in the documentation regarding the permissions changes I made that according to google: 

&gt; If a package declares a permission, the system does not permit the user to install other packages with the same permission name, unless those packages are signed with the same certificate as the first package.

8767,Single subscription for access to multiple apps? Possible? Advisable?,"Background: have a number of paid kid's apps that do fairly well on iOS, but not so much on Google Play where paid apps are not popular.  What we're considering is giving access to all of those apps for a single subscription fee, then releasing regular updates to fit the model.

Looking at Google's Payment APIs it looks like it should be technically possible to have a single subscription cover more than 1 app. HOWEVER I don't see many people doing this approach which makes me wonder if we're missing something.

So two questions:

1. Am I reading the Documentation correctly, it is possible to share a subscription across multiple apps?

2. If I take a paid app and make it free with this subscription system, is there any way to determine that an existing user paid for the app already? (so i can give them unlimited usage).  I have not found anything in the docs about how to get at whether a user paid for the app up front, only for in-app purchases.

8776,"Have Web and Mobile Apps? Manage Your GPS Data with ""GPS data as a Service""","&gt;Change the way location data is handled with “GPS data as a Service”.

As IOT and location-based apps proliferate, the challenge of managing and utilizing GPS data in a meaningful way assumes a lot of importance. The advent of API accessed mapping software such as Open Street, Google, MapQuest, etc., has revolutionized the way we use maps. A similar change is on its way as it relates to location-based data.

Currently, app developers whether they be individuals or corporations manage GPS data generated by their solutions themselves. GPS data adds up very quickly. Indexing, storage, retrieval and real-time analytics and decisioning consume a lot of resources and require considerable expertise to manage the impact on system performance. Performance optimizations and scaling are huge challenges. The costs can really add up. Logistrics offers a specialized “GPS data as a Service” that can handle the large volumes of GPS data, index, store and allow for optimal retrieval, provide real-time analytics that can be used within apps (after all it’s the analytics that matters not the data itself) and offers value-adds such as scheduling, queuing, auto-dispatch etc., based on the data analyzed.

Our API’s are simple to use and require minimal effort to program. We will also be offering libraries in the near future which will make your effort even easier. Our test mode allows you to test and fix issues with your integration.

**Functionality**

* Currently, it supports GPS data handling and management via our platform. We also support geo-fences, speed reports, speed limit violation triggers and mileage reports.

* Over the next several months we hope to add modules with the tools to support hours of service reports, hot spots illustrated on the map, most active hours, order management, dispatch, queuing, field services, mobile inventory and much more.

I'm currently developing an augmented reality game with Vuforia and Unity. I previously released a completely free (And currently ad-free) pure android game with no security. There must be some kind of automated download-and-crack bot checking all the new Android apps, because before I even had 50 downloads it was already cracked and up on websites. The last time I checked, it was on at least 20 websites and the domain owners didn't respond to any of my emails (Big surprise).

So that brings me to my new app, which is taking a lot more time to create. I hope to actually monetize this one correctly and I eventually want to add multiplayer so it would require AN INTERNET CONNECTION! TAKE THAT PIRATES! So I figured I could use this to find people who have cracked versions. Then ban/report them.

Is there anything that you fellow devs can think of besides proguard that could prevent/crack down on people trying to steal my stuff?

8821,Beginner needs help with MediaPlayer and LoudnessEnhancer,"Hi all, first off I hope it's OK to ask questions about using Xamarin in here?

My apologies if not, but assuming it is my problem is that I'm writing a very small app to play mp3's from a folder on my phone via a cable from the headphone jack into an old 8 bit computer that loaded games from tape, the ZX Spectrum +2.  Utilising this cable and enough volume I can load games some 10x quicker then off of tape.

Now the volume from my phone is not loud enough to load the mp3 reliably but I happened to find a [""Speaker Booster""] (https://github.com/arpruss/speakerboost) app which, when I set the boost level to 60, works fantastic, it boosts the volume and the games load perfectly.

I didn't want a system wide boost so I thought I could maybe write a very small app to play an mp3 from a folder on the SD Card and boost the volume at the same time, so I set about reading up on the subject and ended up with [this](https://www.irccloud.com/pastebin/1HnYjt3p/).

Now, whilst this is probably completely wrong it does seem to boost the volume nicely when the cable isn't plugged in and the phone is using the speaker but as soon as I try it with the Spectrum cable into the headphone jack on the phone the sound gets very, very quiet, almost inaudible, instead of boosting it.

Setting the AudioSession to 0 in LoudnessEnhancer, which I believe makes it system wide, means I do get sound from the headphone jack again but it's not boosted.  I copied the SetTargetGain value from the Speaker Booster app that I know works, so I think that's OK.

Could anyone give me any pointers please?

Thank you.",1506917899.0,2017-10-02 04:18:19,3.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/androiddev/comments/73j525/beginner_needs_help_with_mediaplayer_and/

8829,How to design a 'slightly' more intelligent infinite scroll view?,"I am looking to implement an infinite scroll list view, but it should handle when the list is so short all elements in the list are displayed at once and you cannot scroll. In this case I would like the last element to be a ""load more"" button instead of a loading icon.

I figured out how to calculate if all elements are displayed at once, by calculating if layout managers item count equals RecyclerView's item count when layout is completed. Problem is that right now I am hooking into layout managers onLayoutComplete, but even here it causes an IllegalStateException if I try to call notify in the adapter.

Doing the notify asynchronously after a small delay is not ideal either, since it can call notify during the layout of another list update, like the initial loading or refresh etc. Locking in the adapter does not work either, since layout manager updates asynchronously when notified.

TL;DR
I guess my question is two fold:

 * How to handle infinite scroll views with to few elements to scroll? Is there a hook I am not aware of?
 * How to make adapters notify-calls thread safe, and avoid ""IllegalStateException: Cannot call this method while RecyclerView is computing a layout or scrolling""?
 * Or potential third option: Is this a road best not travelled?",1506945176.0,2017-10-02 11:52:56,8.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/androiddev/comments/73ksnb/how_to_design_a_slightly_more_intelligent/

8831,Continuously running instrumentation test on own devices,"I'm curious as to what you all use to run instrumentation tests in your company/for yourself on a continuous basis? I find CI services like Circle to be incredibly slow even for building apk/unit testing, and you can only run instrumentation tests on virtual devices there. 

In order to run on your own devices, what CI/setup do you use to run the tests? Jenkins seems like an obvious solution - you can have a runner with connected devices, but Jenkins is a bitch to set up and maintain (at least before Pipelines, maybe something has changed drastically?). I suppose one can also use TeamCity/GitLab, as both allow using own runners.

Then there's execution - do you just run `./gradlew connectedDebugAndroidTest`, or do you use some tool like Spoon or Fork? Spoon seems pretty, but it doesn't work with Android Studio 3.0, and it seems the development is very slow at best (even Jake Wharton commented somewhere on an issue, that Square doesn't use Spoon internally anymore). So I wonder what is it that you use to run tests on devices, if anything? Something that helps with occasional broken pipes, collecting screenshots possibly, sharding, running only on selected devices etc...",1506958387.0,2017-10-02 15:33:07,6.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/androiddev/comments/73lzst/continuously_running_instrumentation_test_on_own/
8832,Why XML for android is written between opening tag ? Not between the opening and closing tags like HTML.,"So XML is a markup language for android. But I don't understand why the code is written in opening tag of the element but not in between the element opening and closing tags just like HTML. 

For example this is normal XML, where code is written between tags. 

    &lt;?xml version=""1.0"" encoding=""UTF-8""?&gt;

      &lt;body&gt;Don't forget me this weekend!&lt;/body&gt;

    &lt;TextView android:id=""@+id/text""
          android:layout_width=""wrap_content""
          android:layout_height=""wrap_content""

8875,Need help with controlling Android system settings from within an app,"Hi all,

I'm writing a relatively simple Android app for a school project and I'm really struggling with how to make changes to Android settings. The app is supposed to control a few simple Android security settings: bluetooth, open wifi network notifications, the lock screen, allowing unknown app sources, automatic android updates, wifi hotspot, bluetooth tethering, and inactivity timeout. 

My problem is that I've only been able to find the proper API for the Bluetooth toggle. All of the other settings appear to be locked into constants as outlined [here](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/provider/Settings.Global.html) and I have no clue how to change them or even what I would change them to. I can't find any documentation anywhere about how these things are supposed to be changed outside of the actual Android settings menu. 

Can anyone point me in the direction of some kind of API that provides methods for changing these settings? Or maybe someone can just tell me what I'm missing so I can feel dumb and move on with the project? I'm a bit of a beginner with Android and was hoping this would be easy, but I can't seem to find the methods I need to make these changes. 

I figured this was a bit too general of a question for stackexchange. Apologies if I've posted in the wrong place. Thanks in advance. ",1507072481.0,2017-10-03 23:14:41,2.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/androiddev/comments/73wpo6/need_help_with_controlling_android_system/

8878,I'm done with the Android Transitions API,"Fair warning, I'm gonna rant a little here.

I've been working on an app for over a year now, and I am incredibly frustrated by Android's Transitions API. 

Google announced Material Design with the promise of big, beautiful animations and transitions with meaningful motion. As someone trying to follow the guidelines to the books, it's mostly just brought headaches. That said, I've been able to work around most of the problems I've had: the evil sorcery that is CoordinatorLayout, the random crashing of custom animations because of the animation thread, when to use the support library and when to not. 

The Transitions API however, has crossed a line. 

It started out OK, I suppose, if a bit confusing. Activity Transitions were my first experience with Transitions, and while I can't say I really knew what I was doing, in the end everything seemed to work after following the tutorials to the letter, and I got some nice looking and pretty smooth shared element transitions.

It all went downhill from there.

I soon realized that I wasn't going to be able to accomplish what I needed to with Activities alone. I poked around a bit, and decided on Conductor. After all, it was the new, hip thing to try, right? 

Big mistake. 

Shared element transitions in Conductor were an absolute *nightmare*, exacerbated greatly because I could never figure out why anything was going wrong (this will be a common theme going forward). I looked up some tutorials, ported my transitions over, and... nothing. It just blinked and flashed several times before abruptly popping to the next screen. So, debug it, right? I looked up my issues and found that it seemed to be a relatively common problem, and there were a few issues on GitHub, with what seemed to be potential solutions. After perusing these solutions for hours, I finally came up with something that sort-of resembled a transition. The problems? First, the entire screen flashed to black before transitioning, entirely ruining the intended effect. Second, the transition was just wrong. The image always immediately teleported to the top-left corner of the screen when beginning the transition. After trying for several more hours in vain (somehow, all the samples worked, despite doing almost the exact same things), I gave up.

Well, it's just an issue with a third-party library, right? So next, I decided to switch to Fragments. The first decision I made was whether to use real Fragments or support library fragments. Despite only having to support 5.0+, to ensure consistency, I decided on support library fragments.

Again, big mistake.

This experience was barely better than Conductor. Although being a little easier to setup, ultimately the issues I had were very similar to those of Conductor. At least this time, the image only teleported about 30 pixels above the intended location rather than the top-left corner. I tried in vain to get this to work, all the while getting more and more confused by the Transitions API, which helpfully provides *no logging whatsoever*. But, at long last, I again was forced to admit defeat.

So, third time's a charm, right? I gave up on the support library and decided I would use the actual inbuilt platform Fragments. And... it worked! To some extent, at least. It wasn't particularly easy, but after debugging several issues, I finally got to a point where the transitions sort-of worked. But not on Lollipop, for some reason, and each transition only worked perfectly once (subsequent times would cause the image to randomly shrink to one-fourth its size). I figured I could solve these later though, and so I happily went on my way, finally able to work on the other parts of the app that had been much neglected through my Transition adventure.

And things were good. Until Oreo.

I didn't get Oreo until about a week ago to test, but let me tell you that it disappointed in a big way. For some unknown reason, Shared Elements have completely stopped working. And I can't get them to work. Despite being armed with all of this past experience, I simply can't get those stupid transitions to function. And there's no error messages or helpful logging of any kind, because there never is. It just blinks from one screen to another like nothing's wrong in the world. This time, it's even broken the *samples*. I downloaded a simple sample, and while the entrance transition did work, the return transition? Gone. No reason why, no explanation, no way to figure out what's going wrong, and that's in a project with 3 classes. 

This time, I'm done with the Transitions API. I've given up letting this ridiculous monster of an API control me. I'm switching to using custom Animations. It's going to be a lot of work, but at this point I don't really care. Anything's better than the Transitions API, and with Animations, at least when something goes wrong I can figure out what it is.

I've been programming for about 3 years (almost exclusively with Python) but I know Java fairly well. Anyways, I'm interested in learning how to create apps for Android but I'm not really sure where to start. I've messed with Android Studio before and made two iOS apps a couple years ago (pre-Swift) but haven't touched mobile app development since. 

Anyways, I'll cut to the chase. It sounds like at this point I should just learn Kotlin instead of using Java since I'm just starting out and it seems more straightforward/easier. Does anyone have any good resources for learning Kotlin? Any other tips for an experienced programmer diving into this field?

8886,best practices architecture shared database inside the app ?,"I recently encounter several 'challenges' with the way I have my database and my login class structured within my project. This makes me ponder whether I am using the correct architecture for this problem. There seems to be a vivid discussion here on architecture so any pointers people might have are most appreciated.  Note that in my case the database is a realtime firebase database and for the login I use AuthUI.

Currently I have a static database class (""MyFirebasedatabase"") which is a default Java class, not an Activity.  ""MyFirebaseDatabase"" calls the constructor of another class ""MyAuthUI"" that calls AuthUI to start the loginactivity . 

To solution to all my problems could be an MVP strucuture with ""MyFirebaseDatabase"" as the view (that extends activity ? ). However are lifetime cycles then still OK and is it possible to have MyFirebasedatabase static ? The issue with static that I found is that callbacks become troublesome.

In short: what are the best practices to set up a shared database in a project and how do you call activities like logins from this shared database. Much looking forward to feedback. Any pointers would be very much appreciated.


As a more detailed problem description: the challenges I encounter with my current implementation are:
1) MyFirebaseDatabase has an ""Init"" function that is run once (by switching a boolean). Sounds like a subideal situation.
2) creating a login screen with AuthUI requires an Activity. This means that I will need to pass the context or Activity as a parameter trough ""MyFirebaseDatabase.Init(Context context)"" which then passes it as a parameter to ""MyAuthUI(Context context)"". It works but due to my ""noobyness"" I am not sure what might happen with this structure in the future - doesn`t sound very faillsafe to me.
3) If I signal a new user registration in ""MyAuthUI"" I want to handle the databaseInitialization of this new user in ""MyFirebaseDatabase"" (Kind of like an MVP structure between MyFirebaseDatabase which would be the view and MyAuthUI which would be the presenter). This is currently not possible.

Since I am currently deciding what direction to take, I thought your opinion might provide helpful insight. After all you are the people who I am hoping to make it easier for. My questions are:

- Do you know about any Android encryption flaws? How about other mobile platforms?
- Have you implemented encryption in a mobile app? If not, how about in any app?
- If you have implemented encryption, what issues did you encounter when implementing encryption? If you haven't implemented encryption, why did you choose not to implement encryption in your app?
- If you have implemented encryption, what could be different that would remedy you from having those issues?  If you haven't implemented encryption, what would need to be different for you to have implemented encryption?
- How would you order the following suggestions about remedying encryption in Android from most helpful to least helpful?
    - An Android library that requires minimal setup and in which any non-custom settings are safe by default.
    - A guide that explains what TLS/SSL is, how to implement it in Android apps, and how to test your implementation.
    - Some users assume that their TLS/SSL implementation is correct because the HTTP requests they send look like gibberish (e.g. https://media.tumblr.com/tumblr_m0qbiv4vd21qir7tc.png). However, this is not always correct - there is safe gibberish and unsafe gibberish. This option is a test tool for Android that decrypts unsafe gibberish and shows it to you.
    - Many TLS/SSL solutions on StackOverflow are unsafe. This option is posting a corrected solution in the same thread as the unsafe solution and explaining why other solution is unsafe.
- Where do you imagine a guide to be hosted and what format would it have?

Do you see the new architectures as necessary and solving problems that existed or making Android codebases unnecessarily complex and full of boilerplate?

Specifically, the new samples that use MVVM, databinding, and lifecycle components appear to contain an insane amount of boilerplate when compared to MVP.

What is gained from these new architectures that are being promoted?

8956,Do people really care about memory leaks?,"The question arises from two apps I recently downloaded: one for white noise, one for wallpapers. Both with more than a million hits.

The white noise one simply plays its recordings, doesn't let you compose any. I tried maybe 10 of them, left one on for 10 minutes, changed it, then tried a couple others. Close the app and things start to get weird, slow, with phone dying many times at 70% battery. 

Second one, well, I decided to try the orientation-change test: it only took 4 switches to crash the app while downloading a list of high resolution images.

Both are very well reviewed, probably made good money. Still, they have some performance issues: the first one probably goes a little deeper than a simple memory leak, but the second seems the exact definition of it.

Does this happen to many other apps? I'm sure the Big ones like Facebook, Uber ecc.. are perfectly built, but there could be an entire layer of profitable players who simply do not care about unusual behaviour, like me playing with the screen orientation.

What's the situation like?

8960,What is now the preferred way to handle configuration changes when loading data from network?,"Could someone tell me what is considered the best approach in the Android community?

Let's say I use MVP pattern and do network stuff using RxAndroid. And, for a simple example, I want the following - when user refreshes data, the loading indicator is shown, and if the device is rotated, the indicator is shown again. So a pretty basic task. 

Now, there are tons of solutions to this problem. And I keep finding even more the more I read on this. A lot of these solutions revolve around saving Presenters, partially (e.g. by saving Observable somewhere) or entirely (e.g. in a map somewhere in a Singleton). However, personally I find this Presenter-saving business a bit clumsy.

The way I see the solution, we can just make our network calls in a Repository and make it a Singleton. This way a Presenter doesn't save itself and is simply created from scratch after a configuration change. It then can subsribe to the Repository (via Listener interface or, again, via Observable) to get current loading status, and unsubsribe when the View is destroyed (to avoid memory leaks). Doesn't it make more sense to handle data loading in a place that doesn't need to worry about lifecycle issues? 

So, again, is there a common approach in the community? If not, I'd love to know your personal opinions on this matter.

By the way, is RoboSpice (and the usage of Service to perform data loading in it) considered outdated now?",1507334168.0,2017-10-06 23:56:08,16.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/androiddev/comments/74k2ej/what_is_now_the_preferred_way_to_handle/

The company I work for is using Draft.js on the web. However, we are now expanding to mobile and are creating the mobile version for both our Android and iOS native apps. The question is how and whether it is possible to display the json output of Draft.js in an Android native application, just like web is doing it with React? Is there any library that parses the Draft.js json and displays the result in somekind of native Android view? The same question applies to iOS.

Thank you so much for the support, Draft.js seems awesome!

PS: Then comes the more complicated question. How to do the other way around, meaning having a native Draft.js Android editor that creates the same content as web does and produces the json output of Draft.js at the end.

...

I also found a reddit post that actually states the following:

""Draft-js is unopinionated on how the data should be exported. It is upto the dev on how they want to represent the raw data provided by draft-js. Once you understand the data representation, you can export it to html, markdown or even native views of android or ios.""

2. OneSky. They have a serious bug where strings marked `translatable=""false""` still show up as needing translation. I reported this bug in July, they reported it fixed in August, and I just tried it now and it's still broken.

We have poured so much into the passion project - I feel so down. To have the project come to a halt at the 11th hour.

I am wondering what options do we have?
- Do I take the source code and find a freelancer? But where do I find a freelancer who can finish a complicated CMS in a short amount of time. The internet is awash with fake reviews and empty promises
- Do I stick with them and demand they hire a more competent CMS dev?

9011,Best Android Dev book for someone with zero programming experience?,"Hi All,

I've searched several times but have only found books that were either old or applied to android only.

I'd like to dive right in with android development. The only problem is that I haven't coded in several years (C++) so for all intents and purposes I'd describe myself as having zero programming experience.

Also, I know that there are plenty of great resources online but I'd prefer to have a physical book I could go through.

Is there a book that goes through the necessities of Java and then through Android?

Or would you recommend two books?

I was looking at the For Dummies book and that seemed OK. The Big Nerd Ranch looked like you needed to know Java.

Any recommendations?

9015,3 months since started to work as Android dev. Need some guidance.,"Hi guys,

A little background:

So my story is that I graduated from uni with a CS degree and applied to a well-funded IOT startup for a job as an entry level Android dev in a startup. 
Previously I had some experience with Java (maintaining a game server and implementing new features) and had experience creating desktop apps (C# .NET).
Anyways after I applied for a job, I got a technical assignment which I had to complete in 2 weeks (I spent literally at least 10 days investing 8 hours every day). Before that I had no android experience what so ever. The result was that I managed to mock up somewhat decent looking UI(based on UX/UI designer's sketch) which was pulling data from REST API and displaying it. I got the job.

Current situation

So I relocated to another country got a nice relocation package and my work began. It's a 15-20 people startup so I'm the only one doing mobile apps(Android) at the moment so I have to self learn everything, no code reviews. I already spent 2 months in the company and if you include my first month of self learning I currently have 3 months of experience with developing native android apps.
During those 2 months I had to develop two apps. 
First app AR app (which detects a marker, then displays a 3D model on top of that marker, and if you click on model it displays some data pulled from REST API). Basically all I did was found a nice ARToolkit ar jPCT wrapper from github which I changed slightly to display data, and also adapted application to work on a tablet as well.
Second app is kind of an administration panel app. User logs in, sees a list of available devices(fetched from REST 
API), if he clicks on a device he gets data from MQTT, and finally he sees some iframed graphs as well. That’s it.

Problem

I feel that during those 3 months I didn’t learn enough and I’m worried about my further development. Even before starting to do this job my OOP foundations were not solid. 
What helped me to get on track in the beginning was book “Android Programming: The Big Nerd Ranch Guide (3rd Edition)”, but after 2 weeks I got bored of following it and open it only sometimes when I need to look something up.


Also I’m trying to follow google blueprints architecture (google samples from github) but all I currently can grasp and hold on to is MVP pattern which makes most sense for me at the moment. But I know that it would be a shame to show my first apps to any experienced dev as the code is not clean at all.
I learned some basics already(my last app is divided into layers as I started following MVP, so at least not everything is in one Activity anymore), but I feel that the scope is too large and it’s too easy to get lost yourself in small details. For example sometimes I might spend one week on implementing a simple UI feature and it gets me frustrated. I still have lots of holes in OOP fundamentals, having a hard time wrapping my head around advanced tools such as unit/ui testing, dependency injection and etc. 

Can you guys share some of your experience on how you started and how much time did it take for you to start writing clean code and get a good grasp on how to make proper apps? Any references for learning would be much appreciated.

TL;DR;

Got an entry level job as an android dev.  It's a 15-20 people startup so I'm the only one doing mobile apps(Android) at the moment so I have to self learn everything, no code reviews. Made first 3 apps but they are all shit (barely following mvp pattern and all code is mostly copy-pasted+slighty changed). Having a hard time wrapping my head around advanced tools such as testing, dependency injection and etc.  Feel like an imposter and not talented at all. Need some guidance.

Can you guys share some of your experience on how you started and how much time did it take for you to start writing clean code and get a good grasp on how to make proper apps? Any references for learning would be much appreciated.

9044,Access to app market data for indie devs,"Hey there r/androiddev. I work at Priori Data, an app market intelligence company. We have a program for smaller developer studios that I think you might be interested in: the **Data Partner Program**. 

(Sorry if this is too r/HailCorporate for this place but we really aim this at indie/smaller devs and I think a lot of you would benefit from it.)

TL;DR -- If you give us read-only access to your app data, we'll give you 12 months of access to our service (worth $2,400)

##In Depth FAQ

###What do I get with this offer?

By partnering with us you will get 12-months of free access to the Basic App Intelligence plan. That’s 10 competitor apps to check daily historical and country-level download and revenue estimates for per month. You will of course be able to check our estimates for your own apps for free.

###What does Priori Data get out of this?

We view it as a data-for-data exchange: give us access to your data - improving our mobile data accuracy - and we’ll give you access to ours.

What we need is a view-only access to your iTunes Connect account and your Google Play Console. This is done by inviting a user created by us to your app store accounts and giving it specific roles: ‘Sales’ and ‘Reports’ on iTunes and ‘Finance’ with Global Visibility on Google Play. It doesn’t take more than 5 minutes. Visit this page to get started!

###What are the requirements?

There are no size restrictions for who can become a data partner. We hope that by being part of our program we can help you achieve the next level of success.

Nevertheless, we do have some key eligibility requirements which are outlined below.

We reserve the right to revoke your access to our offer if we discover that you are not complying with the requirements as stated.

####Requirements

You need to have a live ranked app in the Google Play Store and/or the Apple App Store.

Our offer is at at the enterprise level. That means that if you have 20 apps across three different publisher accounts, you must connect all accounts. 

You are not permitted to use the information for external or commercial purposes without separate agreement. We're generally nice, flexible people, so it’s best to have a conversation with us. If you have any specific questions, please contact us directly (we love to chat apps).

###How is my data used?

We use your data to get a better understanding of the market in which you are evolving. Put simply, your data helps us improve our accuracy for your competitive environment. If you would like to understand how, check out this comprehensive look at our data methodology and accuracy we’ve recently shared on our site.

###Is my data safe?

We never show, share nor sell it to any third party: it is solely used to feed and improve our estimate models. 

By default, data shared as part of the Publisher program is covered by our strict Data Security Policy. 

If you are still not convinced we are also happy to sign a Non Disclosure Agreement. Please do not hesitate to request one from your Priori Data contact.

###Will my real data be displayed on the Priori platform?

No. All the data in the platform is estimated.

The data you provide goes into our models (if we get enough, we update those models) which then provide all the statistics we show on the platform.

This means that your competitors will not be able to see your actual performance on our platform - only our estimates.

###How good is your mobile data accuracy?

While we strive to be as accurate as possible for all apps, there are multiple reasons why our estimates for your apps may differ from your actual numbers:

First and foremost, we take your data privacy very seriously. Partners that share data never have their actual data shown in the platform, which means estimates are always shown. Due to the estimation methods we use, which rely on publicly available information combined with publisher data points, some variance from your actual numbers is to be expected. 

Because rank is a major signal for our models, our estimates for apps that have spent a significant amount of time outside of the top charts may also be less accurate.

In some markets, we are more accurate than others. Our accuracy depends on the number of partners we have in specific country/category combinations. Therefore, if your app is in one of the combinations in which we do not have a considerable amount of partners, it is probable that you find a gap between our estimates and your real numbers.

Finally, apps that have large fluctuations in performance historically are much harder to retrospectively estimate. For apps such as these, we may be less accurate.

If you want to see how accurate we are for your market, we have made a report publicly available that shows our accuracy by country and category. You can see that here.

###Can I opt out of the offer if I am not happy with it?

Of course. We built this offer so that you’re always in the driver’s seat. If you are no longer happy with our partnership, you can opt out simply by deleting the user that you invited when connecting your account with us

(When and if that happens, we will discontinue your free access to our platform).

###Do you have anything about this I can show my team?

9056,How to avoid side effects (manipulating state) while using Rxjava?,"

from this nice article about observOn() and subscribeOn() 

http://tomstechnicalblog.blogspot.com.eg/2016/02/rxjava-understanding-observeon-and.html

""That is why immutability should be your default policy with properties, and when properties have to be mutable you use synchronization. While you should always strive for immutability, RxJava greatly reduces the likelihood of race conditions and other multithreading problems. Problems will only likely happen when you create side effects manipulating objects outside the Observable chain.""

what do you think about the last line?

""Problems will only likely happen when you create side effects manipulating objects outside the Observable chain.""

I remember watching Jake Wharton talk about  Managing state with Rxjava, and he gave a nice way to model Views so everything belong to the chain .. his way is efficient, but needs extra effort. 
here is the talk 
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0IKHxjkgop4&amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;t=11m15s

Is there any more ideas about how to avoid side effects while using Rxjava?

9074,We set up an in-app chat for our app and I think it helped us sidestep a few negative reviews. Here is how we did it.,"TL;DR, if you just released an App, you should look at Freshchat. Helps your users chat with you from within the app. 


Before I get started, let me tell you that I have no stats to back up my claim that I have been able to minimise negative reviews. We implemented this as soon as we started seeing the reviews and so we did not get a chance to measure. 

A quick background. I am not a solo dev. I have a team working with me. We have been working on this for at least a year now. I started my career coding, but for this app, all I have done is user acquisition, product direction and other meaningless stuff :).

Back to the main story. When we released our App, we talked it up on social media and also asked our friends and family and everyone was happy to try it out. A few of them left reviews. Needless to say, all of them were glowing. So far so good eh?

Now I started to run some ads on FB (that is a whole beast by itself). Very soon, people I did not know were trying out the app and then the results were mixed. We started getting a few bad reviews. Some of them we deserved (crashes that we fixed). But some could have been avoided with a little bit of communication. I tried responding to the reviews quickly but that did not help. Clearly, once you decide to uninstall an app, there is no going back :).

I thought it would be cool to have a way for users to chat with me from within the app. Before I started to roll my own, I wanted to check out if there were SDKs out there already. The search threw up a lot of results for web-based chat. The sort that you could use to convert visitors to users. There were a few apps that did offer in-app chat (helpshift and intercom) but they were part of a bigger package and cost money. Some of them offered trials. But a 14 day trial does not help in these situations because (1) it takes a few days to roll the solution out and then have everyone upgrade. And (2) you need a month to decide if this works and you want to pay. 

We were already using Freshdesk but had not heard of hotline, an in-app chat product from Freshdesk. We decided to give hotline a try because (1) it was free till you hit a certain MAU (it is 10k MAU now) and the guys at hotline were willing to help us with the integration. 

What did we do with hotline

1. Hooked up the SDK to our App - took us two days to build and test fully.

2. Hooked up user conversation to a slack channel so that everyone could see when a user tried to reach out.

3. Created shortcuts for some answers that we had to repeat (asking for logs for example )

4. Setup office hours so when users were reaching late at night, they knew they had to wait.

At first, we did find it difficult to respond to users because there was no hotline mobile app (there is one now) and getting to the console from the phone was a pain in the ass. But once we integrated slack, we were able to respond much faster. The downside was that we could not use shortcuts from within the slack channel (apparently this has been fixed in Freshchat, Hotline’s new avatar)

Things got better from this point. Users started reaching out to us. We were able to head off a few negative reviews. We also added a pointer for fresh users telling them they could chat with us for support. We also started talking it up on the responses to reviews. 

The cool thing is when I saw a sudden surge in users last month, I did not have to do anything to figure out the source. I asked the guys who were reaching out for help and one of them pointed me out to the review that was generating the traffic. 

We have now hooked up hotline to JIRA via Freshdesk so we can actually analyse patterns to user requests and maybe make a few changes to the App.

Note: Hotline is now Called Freshchat. They also have a mobile app now.

9083,One fragment / activity generally?,"Hey guys, I'm a beginner at android dev. I'm almost finished with the Big Nerd Ranch book and I'm loving the process so far. 

Here's a question about fragments/activities. In the BNR book, they structure apps so that it contains an activity whose sole purpose is to launch the fragment. The fragment contains all of the UI views and most of the code. 

It wasn't really something I thought about while working through the book, but I realized that you could have just as easily built the app by putting the UI into the activity itself. So instead of transitioning screens like this:

Activity 1 -&gt; Fragment 1 -&gt; Launch Activity 2 -&gt; Launch Fragment 2

you can just do Activity 1 -&gt; Activity 2. Or you could even do Activity 1 -&gt; Fragment 1 -&gt; Fragment 2

So basically my question is that is it common to build one activity to hold one fragment generally? Just seems that having nearly empty activities per fragment to be pointless.

I am making an app that allows a user to upload newly taken photos to a server.

in the options menu I would like to give them an option to restrict uploads to only work when both the WiFi is on and also to only upload photos when the Phone is charging.  (kinda the way Google Drive does it)

originally I thought maybe just wake the phone up every couple of hours check if the user defined conditions are met, and if so start the upload. 

but before I started writing I decided maybe there is a better way to implement this, is there a way to make a service listen to state changes and fire up when applicable? 

I don't need code examples..  just a general answer to know if this is the right direction.. or maybe I should think of another solution.

ideally I want the entire process to be as non-intrusive as possible towards the user's battery. 

so if anyone has any pointers as to what the right approach is I would greatly appreciate the feedback.

Cheers.|

9091,What would you recommend for going about loading data in an app like this?,"I'm building an app in which a user can convert from one currency to another. How it works is this:

- A user creates a card and on card creation, the user specifies the currencies he is converting to and from.
- This card is then added to a recycler view.
- When a card is clicked on, it takes the user to a screen where he can enter an amount and get the conversion in the currency he has chosen.

The conversion rate is queried from an API. My question is with loading the data from the API and I'm considering 3 options:

1) Since the currencies that the users can choose from is a fixed list, would it be better to make the API call and get the exchange rate for all the currencies when the app is initially opened and then store that data somewhere?

2) Should the API call only be made when a user selects a card. i.e before the Recycler view is updated, it shows a progress bar when it is loading the data for the currency that was chosen?

3) When a user selects a card, then it makes the API call to get the exchange rate for that card.

Which one of these 3 options would you recommend for loading the data from the API?? Or do you have any other recommendations?",1507744104.0,2017-10-11 17:48:24,0.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/androiddev/comments/75j9jx/what_would_you_recommend_for_going_about_loading/

9099,Just released my first app on the play store! Feedback on source code please? Be as brutal as possible.,"Hey guys,

Since July I've been working on my first Android app. I'm a professional developer with two years of experience outside of Android. I decided to learn Android as a way to test my skills in learning new things. Feels like a long road. I worked on it when I could after work. 

There was plenty of struggles. At times I would go days (or weeks sometimes?) without touching the app since I was stuck on some problem. I was able to work through them though and my app is out on the play store now. I wanted to get some feedback on [my code](https://bitbucket.org/recheej/persona5app) from experienced Android devs.

Notes:

- I used Dagger 2 for DI. Took some time to understand Dagger. In fact, I rewrote most of my Dagger 2 implementation at one point because I felt like I wasn't doing it right. I still don't feel like I really used it right. Feedback on how I set up my components, sub components and what not would be great.

- As far as architecture goes. I kind of went for MVVM. I read up on Google's new architecture components and I liked their examples where they had a ViewModel and a repository behind it. That's basically how my app is set up (without actually using arch. components). My activities/fragments have ViewModels injected and the view models have repositories injected. I unit tested my view models since I tried to put most logic in there.

- One of the most important things to me was performance. Part of my app includes making kind of intense calculations. At first I did the calculations up front on the main thread in the main activity on first load and stored results. This meant LONG first loading time. I later decided to create an IntentService that did the calculations in the background since they weren't needed for the first activity anyways. Thoughts on this? Any way I could have done better?

- The least favorite thing I did in the app was store everything in shared preferences. I thought about sql, but I won't lie, I felt lazy to implement sql. Also, my data is kind of simple and I didn't really need relations from. At the end, some of the stuff I was doing with shared pref felt kind of hacky. I stored the results of my calculations in shared pref and it's a lot of data. Felt like I could have stored it somewhere else. Files may be? I also did a lot of stuff like store data in shared pref that's going to be used in the next activity. I stored whole models in shared pref. Like I said, felt dirty, but it works right now and my performance is good (in my own testing, we'll see what users say)

Anyways, let me know your feedback on the code. I'm just proud to be able to say that I finally finished a side project and it's something in production.

My team is starting to use it in a big android app, we decided against Dagger 2 because of it's hard coded dependencies in the components. We need a dynamic structure of plugins for the app which are designed as library/gradle modules.
We also didn't like the need of creating a lot of components and modules.
So we tried Toothpick and so far we are happy with it. But we are just starting to refactor our app. So we would like to ask if anyone has experience with the library.

Hence, I wanted to get more or less objective picture of what community thinks about both approaches:  
- How many projects in the wild have adopted the custom view approach in favor of Fragments?  
- If you have switched, which navigation manager are you using?  
- If Googlers are reading this, are there any plans on creating a ""simpler"" framework to replace Fragments in near future? ;)",1508071295.0,2017-10-15 12:41:35,13.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/androiddev/comments/76b8hm/using_custom_views_instead_of_fragments/

9205,Wrote my first app! Android 8.0 promptly broke it.,"All I wanted was an app to automatically disable Bluetooth - a homescreen widget to turn Bluetooth on for 60 seconds, and a service to turn it off again if no connection is made, or after the connection is broken if one is made. Was that so wrong?

According to Android 8.0 and [its new rules about BroadcastReceivers](https://developer.android.com/about/versions/oreo/background.html#broadcasts) and background services, the answer apparently is ""yes."" The new rules include an exemption for the `ACTION_CONNECTION_STATE_CHANGED` broadcast, which can tell me when Bluetooth connections are made and broken, but I also need `ACTION_STATE_CHANGED` to know when the Bluetooth adapter turns on and off. (I don't want auto-shutoff to kick in if the user enabled Bluetooth from Settings instead of from my widget.)

There is some unhelpful language in the Android Developer Guide about using `JobScheduler` to replace the newly prohibited behavior but I haven't been able to come up with an incantation that works, and I'm not sure one exists.

Can someone help me understand how things should now be done? I think the simplest question I can ask is this: how would you write a homescreen widget that changes its icon depending on whether the Bluetooth adapter is on or off? If I get that answer I'll know how to proceed with the rest.

Thanks so much!

9207,Using Kotlin on the server side ?,"Hi, I'm just curious if anyone else is using Kotlin on the server side in a live environment. We have been using Kotlin / Scala / Java on the server side for most of the server-side architecture for mobile apps and also developing some open-source libraries / tools in Kotlin. 

Lately, I find myself preferring Kotlin simply to use 1 language for both client/Android and server development. It has definitely resulted in less work, costs, and mental switching between languages, and I'd rather work in Kotlin over Java any day :-). 

Just curious how the community is using Kotlin for non-android development. FYI, we are using **Kotlin w/ Spark Java** for microservices/web-apis, and integrating with AWS for cloud services ( S3, SQS, EC2 ).

1. Are you currently using Kotlin on the server side ?
2. If so, what libraries/tools/frameworks are you using in Kotlin ?
3. If not, what is your server language of choice and/or backend?

Thanks.

9245,Is using RxJava and Kotlin a bad idea for a major size SDK?,"I'd like to know if it's a bad idea to use these dependencies (RxJava and Kotlin) for a major size SDK. By major size I mean an SDK that will play a big role on an app.

We're currently selling a feature, glueing code onto customer's codebase and connecting the necessary hooks and UI to make things work. That being said, our code is sometimes sold by the customers as a great feature or even main feature of their apps, which gives us a greater edge on decisions.

Still, we don't want to have to manually glue the code to each customer needs, and decided to modularize parts of our code (core and extras) to the point that it would be easy for the customer itself to do the job, or at least make things easier and faster for us. So we thought of making it an SDK.

Thus, we're worried about bloating our code and also about possible compatibility problems. Crashlytics and other common dependencies will have to be shipped with the SDK, but RxJava and Kotlin would give a nice productivity boost to us. Still we don't want to held customers hostage of having to explicitly work with Kotlin or RxJava, neither of maintaining the same version as the SDK.

9255,Gradle Use Lots of Memory,"**App Design:**
Entire app consists of 7040 java files:

1 ""huge"" module (old module where all code previously reside in this module,  ~500 XML with databinding, 4000 java files)

15 library modules

1 ""app"" module

app module depends on the 15 library modules. Each of those library modules depends on the ""huge"" module.

**AnnotationProcessor used:**
dagger, databinding, dart &amp; henson, parceler.

**Gradle Setting:**

    org.gradle.daemon=false
    org.gradle.jvmargs=-Xmx8704M -XX:+UseCompressedClassPointers -XX:+UseCompressedOops
    org.gradle.workers.max=8
    org.gradle.configureondemand=true
    org.gradle.parallel=true
    org.gradle.caching=false

    android.enableAapt2=true

**Machine: Macbook Pro 2017 16 GB**

**Build Times:**
If changes are in one of those smaller modules, the time is relatively short. About 2-3 minutes.
But when doing full clean build for the entire app, it took 12-20 minutes.

**Memory Problem:**
When building for first time it will complete within 12-20 minutes. But after that it can took as long as 30 minutes. The ""java"" process is taking so much memory (~9.7GB) and not GCed, thus we need to kill that ""java"" process every time before compile. Otherwise it will hang in there since it needs more memory.

Since ""huge"" module consists of lots of databinding XMLs, we found out that **every XML will be copied to each library module** because those modules depends on the ""huge"" module. Since there are 500 files on the ""huge"" modules, it will create 500x15 generated files in all modules. We thought this may be why the ""java"" process took so much memory.  If we create another library module, it'll add 500 more generated files, thus making the ""java"" process need more memory.

The solution may seems obvious right now: Decouple the ""huge"" modules into smaller modules, but this needs some effort and time to complete. We're looking for short time solution for now. 

--edit--

 I'm not saying that we're not doing the decoupling project right now (those 15 smaller modules are the result of this project), but more like we need short term solution to enable our next release cycle. While waiting for the decouple project to be done.

9285,Are the software interviews getting too opinion-based rather than focused on skills?,"This is not a rant by any means, but I just want to see what others think of the recent trends in software interviews.

I recently went on an interview with a well-established ""startup"" because I wanted to see what the market is like. Everything went so well. Lots of discussions about Android and my current job. The manager loved my attitude and knowledge (found out later by asking him about the interview). 

There was a coding challenge, of course, as with most interviews these days. Now the challenge was an Android app that needed to do something and I had to write it. I struggled a bit at first because I have been away from front-end for a while and they were aware of that. After about 15-20 minutes I solved it with a fairly straight forward and easy to understand solution that aligned well with Android design. The task touched a number of things like MVP, TextWatcher, consuming web services and so on. However, I didn't get the job. I asked them to give me some feedback and found out that the manager didn't like my approach in using a Handler and posting a delayed Runnable to solve the problem and instead was looking for a solution that used TimerTask. Bear in mind that this was one part where one line of code needed to be run with a delay.

I can't wrap my head around the difference this makes in getting the job done rather than personal preference. I've had similar experiences before but never asked about the interview. I feel like the interviews are getting derailed from focusing on whether a person can do a job (or do it well) and getting more focused on whether the code aligns with the hiring manager's preferences. What's next? People getting rejected for not liking to use Dagger or using AsyncTask instead of RxJava? Does it all matter what you use if you can do the task well?

I just want to see if others have had similar experiences or maybe I am missing something or maybe I just had some bad interviews.",1508372436.0,2017-10-19 00:20:36,44.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/androiddev/comments/773dnk/are_the_software_interviews_getting_too/

**Warning**: Please continue using the [FusedLocationProviderApi](https://developers.google.com/android/reference/com/google/android/gms/location/FusedLocationProviderApi) class and don't migrate to the [FusedLocationProviderClient](https://developers.google.com/android/reference/com/google/android/gms/location/FusedLocationProviderClient) class until Google Play services version 12.0.0 is available, which is expected to ship in early 2018.

My predicament is as follows: I'm building a pretty large mobile game which features unlockable content. Currently, the plan is to involve loot boxes gained by playing which can only be opened with keys gained either by playing or purchasing. The truth is: I'm a little against this. I'd love to make the game itself purchasable for a few dollars and make all of the content unlockable just by playing. But, is this actually doable? The primary target audience will be the fans of a YouTube channel with around 1m subs (the game is made in cooperation with them). So it's not like the game wil just be thrown out in the open without any sort of marketing.

9298,DISCUSSION: To Google or not to Google. The google way vs 3th party solutions in presentation layer.,"We started developing a skeleton(template) project in our company a while ago as a blueprint for new projects and to have some discussion about how to do things the right way. We started some development before google i/o so before architecture components where announced and now I'm torn on some decisions we made on the presentation layer (clean architecture). We use **Mosby** as our MVP/I library and now there is the **ViewModel** from arch components and we went for **Conductor** instead of **Fragments**. Historically when there was a library from google and well established third party solution I learned the rule of thumb is **community &gt; google**. Libraries like volley and others where more like a random eruptions of open source activity from individual teams at google rather then well thought out complete strategy like architecture components seems to be. I'm really looking forward to just a little bit more ""standardized"" android ecosystem so you don't have to teach every new developer in your team all the special nuances of your special kind of android development with all the obscure libraries and stuff.  Now I know there is no right answer to this, I just want to list my pros and cons and hear what you have to say.

**Fragments vs Conductor**


**Why fragments:** 

More used, bigger chance you hire someone with experience

More examples from usage, more docs

New Arch Lifecycle management is build right for them (conductor has some support now but...)

Dagger2 has some conveniences for them now (you can achieve something similar for conductor with some boilerplate)

Other android components are build for them (support library widgets etc.)


**Why Conductor:**

Easier to understand

Simpler lifecycle

Integration with RxJava lifecycle or autodispose

Less bugs ( just my opinion :) ) 

You can fix your favorite bug with a pull request


**ViewModel vs Mosby** (I know they are not 1:1 comparable but still) 


**Why Arch ViewModel:**

Over time, this will be more familiar solution for most developers

Better integration with other components especially in the future

Will probably be more battle tested over time



**Why Mosby:**

Much more functionality right now

MVI support

ViewState support

Conveniences like LCE or Null Object presenter

To me.. still better way to unclutter your view from all the logic

Right now I don't see a clear answer but in the future I can see there will be more and more arguments for google's point of view.

For example, I've found a color that I want to use as the background color of the app. The color looks great in 50% brightness, but it looks too bright in 100%. So, should I stick with that color or try to make it darker so that it looks good even in 100% brightness?

I don't believe it's an issue with the dock, because even plugged into the laptop it self the issue still happens.

9354,Detecting native crashes in third party library so as not to crash the app.,"Bit of a weird one here, folks. Firstly I have no experience in debugging native crashes in Android so stay with me if I'm a bit slow as I am playing catch up.

Our app uses a third party charting library that at some point uses native code to draw the charts. On Android 8 Oreo and a Nexus 5X device I can get the app to crash itself when a chart is drawn, then putting the app into the background, then opening it up again. Upon resuming the activity / fragment with the rendered chart the app goes BOOM! What's interesting is that the if the chart isn't drawn on the screen and I put the app in the background and recall it, nothing crashes.

Reading the [docs on debugging native code](https://source.android.com/devices/tech/debug/native-crash), I've got a backtrace on my work computer that refers to libskia.so which if I understand correctly is something to do with OpenGL. I can **only** reproduce this on API26.

My problem is I have **no** idea how to detect this at runtime and even begin to workaround it. Say, for example, I had a regular non native crash in Java. I'd check the stack trace, open the source, breakpoint it a couple times, and eventually figure out what the condition was that is causing the crash and either guard against it or write better code so that it never happens again. At the worst I can attempt some sort of try-catch logic.

I'm genuinely at a loss as to what I should do with this one - especially as it isn't to do with code that we have written. 

Anyways, many many thanks.

Edit: What started off as a null pointer dereference error in libskia has now been worked around in the Java code. Yaaay that's the best type of fix /s. 

For this interested, we use a third party charting library that calls into native code, Shinobi Charts. On resume it was trying to reload the already drawn chart and bumming out. My workaround was to manually reload the chart rather than relying on it to reload itself in the onResume.

For now I'm glad that we got to the bottom of this. Personally I'm kicking myself for not getting involved in the developer preview of Oreo rather than attempting to appease my overlords with adding features.",1508531720.0,2017-10-20 20:35:20,3.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/androiddev/comments/77hdhj/detecting_native_crashes_in_third_party_library/

9386,How does the Nexus 5X perform accelerometer calibration?,"I have a Nexus 5X and am using it to collect accelerometer data for a car using the app [Torque](torque-bhp.com).  I used an in-app ""Calibrate Accelerometer"" option, drove with the phone mounted tilted about 20º forward (roll angle), and collected data for a bunch of trips.  I am currently trying to estimate an OBD port acceleration curve (which comes directly from the car) using the noisier device acceleration.

Torque has little documentation, so it's difficult to determine what the x, y, and z coordinates of acceleration represent.  Based on [this plot](https://imgur.com/SX7NRVc), it appears that at our mounted angle, x is forward movement, y is gravity, and z is close to 0 but is also correlated with x.  But taking the dot product of the x and z coordinates leads to [a worse fit to the true acceleration than for just x](https://imgur.com/2uZBWHt).

I'm confused.  What, precisely, is calibration doing to set the x and z-directions of acceleration?  What do the three directions actually represent?",1508627621.0,2017-10-21 23:13:41,11.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/androiddev/comments/77p8dl/how_does_the_nexus_5x_perform_accelerometer/

9390,I'm new to Java and have no idea where to start.,"A few days ago I came up with a great idea for an app. I decide, right, no one else has done this, I'm going to do it. I'm going to learn how to make an app. I don't care how long it takes.

A few less days ago, I took Codecademy's Java course. I already know JavaScript so it should be easy, right? Nope.

I have a very basic idea of how Java works now. Enough to start developing, probably. Let's take the official ""[Building Your First App](https://developer.android.com/training/basics/firstapp/index.html)"" tutorial. Great, now I have an app that displays some text. And it even runs on my phone. All done!

Except I have no clue how it works, I have no clue why I've typed what I've typed except because the tutorial told me to, and if I wanted to do literally anything other than follow the tutorial again, I have no idea where to start. At least UI design seems intuitive. For now.

&amp;nbsp;

I want to learn. But I have no clue where to even begin. Hell, I've only even put a few hours into learning Java.

I'm okay with putting my app on the sidelines for now, just doing example projects until I'm confident enough. But where do I start? Where can I find a tutorial that's simple enough to understand, but also teaches me skills instead of just instructing me?

9401,I'm having trouble scheduling a notification,"In my app, a user can add a reminder to a specific item in a list. A notification will come up at the specified time reminding them to take action on that item. However, for some reason my notifications show up immediately because the millisecond amount between the current date and the future date that the user specifies is a negative number. Here is the code:

    public void scheduleReminder(Notification notification, String date, String time){
            String[] dateArray = date.split(""/"");
            String[] timeArray = time.split("":|\\s+"");
            Date currentDate = new Date();
    
            Calendar cal = Calendar.getInstance();
            cal.setTimeInMillis(System.currentTimeMillis());
            cal.clear();
            cal.set(Calendar.YEAR, Integer.parseInt(dateArray[2]) - 1);
            cal.set(Calendar.MONTH, Integer.parseInt(dateArray[1]));
            cal.set(Calendar.DAY_OF_MONTH, Integer.parseInt(dateArray[0]));
            cal.set(Calendar.HOUR_OF_DAY, Integer.parseInt(timeArray[0]));
            cal.set(Calendar.MINUTE, Integer.parseInt(timeArray[1]));
    
            Date reminderDate = cal.getTime();
    
            long diffInMillis  = reminderDate.getTime() - currentDate.getTime();
    
            Intent notificationIntent = new Intent(this, NotificationPublisher.class);
            notificationIntent.putExtra(NotificationPublisher.NOTIFICATION_ID, 1);
            notificationIntent.putExtra(NotificationPublisher.NOTIFICATION, notification);
            PendingIntent pendingIntent = PendingIntent.getBroadcast(this, 0, notificationIntent, PendingIntent.FLAG_UPDATE_CURRENT);
    
            AlarmManager alarmManager = (AlarmManager)getSystemService(Context.ALARM_SERVICE);
            alarmManager.set(AlarmManager.RTC_WAKEUP, diffInMillis, pendingIntent);
        }

reminderDate is the date the user specifies, currentDate is the moment the user clicks the 'save' button for the reminder. Theoretically, reminderDate.getTime() - currentDate.getTime() should return the millisecond value of reminderDate - the millisecond value of currentDate, leaving an accurate amount of milliseconds to schedule the notification in advance. But I get a negative number, and I am totally stumped on how. Any ideas?

Also, in case anyone is wondering: I subtract one when I set the Calendar year because for some reason the Calendar always would set the year one year ahead.

9428,What is everyone's preferred way of Mocking endpoints that aren't ready yet with Retrofit?,"Car2Go release an endpoint mocking library recently (https://github.com/car2go/Endpoint2Mock2) and it got me thinking... why the hell don't I do this yet.

Since then I've been on the hunt for being able to Mock a response with retrofit2 in the easiest way possible.

Thinking about an ideal situation, for me, the way I'd like to mock an endpoint would be to provide sample JSON response (that my server team gives me) and mark one of the rest calls in my RetrofitApiService as @Mocked or something.

I found that Retrofit actually has a mock web server built in, but it seems like if you use that, you have to mock all of your calls. I'm in a project that exists already and we have 40 different calls, and I'm working on adding the 41st call, and would love to be able to test it before the server team deploys it. 
 I also found this article that provides a solution using interceptors, but it seems to be an all or nothing type of deal. Which isn't what I need in this use case. https://blog.davidmedenjak.com/android/2016/11/22/mocking-api-calls.html

What do you all do? I assume this is a pretty common scenario.

9496,How can you remotely trigger flashing a new ROM?,"Hey all, so I have a question that I'm hoping some of the more experienced people could help me answer. I have an android device connected to a network and on this network I would like another device to be able to send a ROM to the android device and then trigger it to update it's current ROM with the one that was pushed. 

I was wondering what are the methods for doing this. The first that comes to mind would be to simply have wifi debugging enabled on the android device and have the other one use ADB to send the commands to flash the new ROM, but I feel like there might be an easier way.

creates a ton of unnecessary objects, and thus creates garbage that must be collected (and produce jank). The solution proposed is:

    Object obj;
    for(int i=0; i&lt;count;i++) {
        obj = arrayList.get(i);

Which of course doesn't change anything. :)
 
What would be the best way to show them that variable assignment doesn't create any object on the heap?

9527,Oauth using php script - Quizlet API,"I have an app competition and the deadline is Monday so I really need to do this.


I need to do oauth in order to access the auth token from the Quizlet API.

Unfortunately I haven't found anything for Android in terms of documentation and I am a novice. The farthest I got was opening the intent to perform oauth, but the code I receive is always null which means that Quizlet is not returning the auth token. I've worked on this for days and can't figure anything out.


I was wondering if it would be possible to call a php script from a server that would run oauth. If it only had the oauth code, would it open a browser by itself? Also would it be possible for it to return the auth token?

Again I know nothing about this. If any of you have had experience accessing the Quizlet API ( actually adding cards to a user's account) please help me.

Looks like currently all aviable options seem not very steamlined: 

1. Self-signed emulator where I can get signature permission - thats pain in the ass in massive testing environments.

2. Running watch script under root in phone's shell, that automatically runs jobs when some flag is present (like, file is created) - thats kinda hacky approach but more light than first one and probably the best one currently.

3. On real devices you can root phone and rearrange smali code for jobscheduler's permission check. Saves a little time not pushing and launching watcher script, but you are messing with assembly code.

Is it me or all these ways are not right? I know you can always mock it all, but in reality not testing entire system creates a lot production bugs.

I understand the type of the application has a huge impact on the overall speed but for this thread, assume the app is a non-graphics heavy simple app.

9559,Google Play search algorithm may be wrongly punishing OpenGL games based on inaccurate rendering times metrics,"Google [recently announced](https://android-developers.googleblog.com/2017/08/how-were-helping-people-find-quality.html) that app quality metrics would be a factor of their search and discovery algorithms. 

At the same time Google added information on the Android Vitals section of the Developer Console about which are the acceptable limits for each metric (not to be punished by the algorithms). They are called ""Bad behaviour thresholds"" and if your app is over any of those thresholds, they are flagged on top of the page as a warning.

This sounds like a reasonable idea but it has a problem with OpenGL games. Even if Google is not able to monitor rendering times (FPS) of OpenGL apps (see the note on their [docs](https://developer.android.com/topic/performance/vitals/render.html)) and render time statistics should not appear in Android Vitals, they wrongly do in some cases. 

The problem I've noticed with my games is that if a game integrates a 3rd party library that uses native UI toolkit (for example it integrates an ad network that displays video ads), the Slow Rendering tab gets populated with statistics exclusively from that library. And because usually these libraries are very resource intensive they tend to be a bit laggy on some devices causing the Slow Rendering statistics for the app to spike.

So, even if after hard work you manage to get your game to run smoothly keeping the fps under 60 on low end devices, Android Vitals may still flag it as bad performer just because of the video ads (and worse, get punished in Google Play).

**tl;dr** OpenGL games may be being punished by the Google Play search algorithm based on an inaccurate measure of their rendering times performance metrics if they implement some 3rd party libraries.",1509145131.0,2017-10-27 22:58:51,44.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/androiddev/comments/78z6wv/google_play_search_algorithm_may_be_wrongly/

9597,[Rant] Images in android,"Anyone who has tried to make an app which contains a few more complex images probably will know what I am talking about. Why can't we get a simple solution for this? Even google suggests to use a library for glide for this basic function. And even Videos are easier to show than a simple image. 

Let's look at all the issues:
Memory management: Android should be able to easily determine the required dimensions of the picture, as in some cases it's just impossible to know beforehand how much I need to scale it down.

Zooming: On iOS it apparently is that simple:

    - (UIView *)viewForZoomingInScrollView:(UIScrollView *)scrollView
    {
        return self.imageView;
    }

In android I luckily found something called TouchImageView on GitHub, but comeon!

Scrolling through my pictures without lag: Gallery apps have somehow done it, but I can't find a solution and no open-source app that manages this. If I use a ViewPager and scroll through images, it lags really hard. Yes it's possible, but shouldn't be that hard.

9598,Kiosk Type App Without Using a MDM.,"So I am building a Kiosk type app. After researching this for a while I found the best way to accomplish this is to create a COSUD (Corporate Owned Single Use Device). Since this project only requires a few devices to be in this mode using an MDM (Mobile Device Manager) seemed like too much. Here is what I did in order to make a device operate in Kiosk mode:

* Add the following to your launching activity:

            &lt;intent-filter&gt;
                &lt;category android:name=""android.intent.category.LAUNCHER""/&gt;
                &lt;action android:name=""android.intent.action.MAIN"" /&gt;
                &lt;category android:name=""android.intent.category.HOME"" /&gt;
                &lt;category android:name=""android.intent.category.DEFAULT"" /&gt;
            &lt;/intent-filter&gt;


This takes care of a lot of the work for you. It will make your app  a launcher which you can select as the default. This will make your app start as soon as the device is booted, as well as lead the user to your launch activity when the home button is clicked.

* Add the following to the same activity:

            android:noHistory=""true""
            android:launchMode=""singleTask""

Setting noHistory to ""true"" will prevent your application from appearing in the recent application list, and singleTask will prevent new instances of your launch activity from being created. 

* In order to prevent users from changing the launcher back to any other launcher, use adb shell to delete any other launchers on the device with the following commands:

            -adb shell pm list packages
            -adb uninstall com.someLauncher.app

The first command will provide all of the package names on the device, the second actually removes it. The first is not needed if the package name is already known. This step may not be necessary since we are locking the settings in the next step, however I included it if for some reason you want the settings to be accessible but don't want the user to change the default launcher. 
 
* Finally you can lock the settings with an App Locker application to require a password to access settings.
(I am currently looking for a solution I can implement in my app but have not found a way to do so yet. Please, if you have any ideas on how to implement this let me know. Thank you.)


That's it! Now your app will open at start up, the navigation buttons will always keep the user within your app, all other apps are not accessible to the user, and the settings are locked down to prevent them from uninstalling your app or changing the defaults. 


This is just how I implemented my version of Kiosk mode, let me know if you have any suggestions to improve going about this!


edit: formatting

edit: I was able to implement the settings lock with the following code. The step I was missing before was that you must add the following to the manifest:

        &lt;uses-permission
        android:name=""android.permission.PACKAGE_USAGE_STATS""
        tools:ignore=""ProtectedPermissions"" /&gt;

Then you have to manually enable the USAGE_STATS permission.

I submitted the following to google play as my appeal:
---------

Good Afternoon,

I have made 3 separate changes recently, &amp; I am uncertain if any or all changes may have resulted in the termination of the account. 

1. Recently had a trade mark dispute with Hasbro which has since been resolved. 
2. I started listing my apps on Amazon to reach a bigger audience. 
3. I have been doing some real world ads testing with different platforms which was made public on the main Facebook page in case any user had issues. All ads and back end processes are now disabled on my free apps just in case. 

Any information you can provide will be greatly appreciated. I enjoy Google Play as a distribution platform and do my best to keep up with any and all changes in policy that have occurred over the years. I welcome any feedback and hope I can continue to do business on Google Play. 

Thank you for your time and consideration,

Hi Developers,

Thanks for contacting Google Play Team.
After reviewing your appeal, we’ve confirmed our initial decision and will not be reinstating your developer account because it violates the Malicious Behavior policy.

Our policy states:

Google Play Developer account terminations are associated with developers and may span multiple account registrations and related Google services. Do not attempt to register a new developer account. Any new accounts will be closed and your developer registration fee will not be refunded. 

We recommend that you use an alternative method for distributing your apps in the future.

Thank you for your understanding.

One last ditch effort, I still have no idea what has happend, I can only assume that google play didn't like a particular ad code I was testing or someone hurt themselves using nearsight vr or one of my novelty scare apps. Hope no one actually was hurt :(

Hi XXXX,

Are you allowed to disclose what happened to my account or what changes may have occurred that did not make my applications compliant? 
I still have no idea what has taken place here.

Quote ""We don’t allow apps that steal data, secretly monitor or harm users, or are otherwise malicious.""

Can you tell me what apps in particular is this referring to? My apps do not steal data, secretly monitor or cause harm? 
Any information would be appreciated. 

Best,

9603,Are web redirect-only apps allowed (trying to convince my company not to release one)?,"**Background:** our company is finally taking seriously the need to have a dedicated, native set of apps (for Android and iOS). Up until now, our online apps have only been WebView/WebKit-wrapped versions of our mobile site.

We had to pull our apps off the app store a few weeks ago because they were experiencing stability issues, and now our VP is hustling me constantly to get them back on the app stores now that the underlying problem was resolved.

**My problem:** their idea of ""updating"" the apps was to just make it into a login screen. After a user logs in, it just takes you out of the app and gets you into our mobile site through a new tab in Chrome/Safari/etc. Not even using WebView/WebKit anymore.

Apple does restrict such apps ([HERE](https://developer.apple.com/app-store/review/guidelines/#functionality), under section 4.2), but for Android I can't find any policy or restriction against apps that are just redirects to a mobile site. Yes, we own our own mobile site, so the Spam directive found [here](https://play.google.com/about/spam-min-functionality/spam/webviews-affiliate/) doesn't apply.


I want to avoid the fiasco of having to clean up the mess of our app being blocked from the Play Store because it skirts the rules, but I need to see if there is a rule against this kind of app functionality (I would hope there is).

Thanks in advance!

9604,"Recently graduated having a hard time finding a job, any tips?","Hi. I know this sounds like an /cscareerquestions thread but I wanted to get the ideas of Android developers here since I'm looking for an Android job. Recently graduated from college (Software Engineering) and I've been developing and learning Android development for 2.5 years now. I'm familiar with the hottest trends Rx, Dagger, MVP, Architecture Components etc. I have used these technologies and released few applications on the market. Wrote a CV by looking up to some examples from people who got into Big 4.
I keep applying for jobs but no one returns back to me. Like %90 of the jobs are looking for a full-time experience for 2 or more years and I got nothing except the 2 interns (2 months total). There are some companies looking for junior devs, I applied all of them too but got no response. I feel like companies do not even give a chance to me. Like I read their posting and have everything they want, I apply then a big nothing. I really want to be an Android developer but I don't think I will ever be one. Considering even improving myself on C# or some backend technologies and applying to those jobs since there are much more postings for them and most of them are looking for juniors.
Is it possible for me to get an Android job after 1 year of working in some company doing non-Android related work? That will feel like hell to me but I will do it if I have to. Or are there any tips you can give out to me? What am I missing? How did you find jobs as a junior developer?

If your app is deployed on thousands/millions of devices, you can monetize it with **REDACTED** mining and earn really huge income.

I'm thinking that aside from being utterly unethical, this violates Google Play's developer regulations, and any app implementing such a system will rapidly be shut down and the account disabled.

I know that I'll probably need some sort of software so the tablet may calculate the center, but without a software how would the tablet with a multitouchscreen interpret a flat object lying on top of it?(already taking into account that the object is capable of passing electricity through it). But since there will probably be a need to calculate the center how should the sole of the object be in that case, should it have a limited amount of points of contact, such as three dots for example, so that the software may calculate the center?

The other question that I had is how small can the sole be so that the touchscreen can identify more than one point of contact and calculate the center, would it be possible to do that(gather many points of contact) with a 1cm of width sole?",1509298648.0,2017-10-29 17:37:28,1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/androiddev/comments/79acci/question_about_touchscreens/

9641,SQLite + RecyclerView,"Hello,
i have some problems with SQLite + RecyclerView. 
I basically built the RecyclerView according to this tutorial, without the data binding part:

https://www.androidauthority.com/creating-sqlite-databases-in-your-app-719366/

Creating tables and rows and displaying them in my RecyclerView works fine, but

1) they never close a Cursor or a database anywhere and i dont know where to do it properly. Apparently closing the database is not that important, but i dont know where to close a Cursor. Especially the one i provide to the Adapter.

2) They dont teach how to delete entries and then update the Adapter. Deleting rows is not the problem, but i have to swap the Cursor in order for my Adapter to show the new data and the examples i found online are hard to understand. I want a simple swapCursor method that does only what is necessary for this basic example. And it has to close the old Cursor properly.
I know there are a few examples for that online, but they usualy contain a lot of code i dont really understand what it is there for.
Also i dont know what Cursor to provide to this swapCursor method.

What i tried was something like this:

    SQLiteDatabase database = new ExampleSQLiteHelper(this).getWritableDatabase();
    Cursor cursor = database.rawQuery(""select * from "" + ExampleContract.ExampleEntry.TABLE_NAME, null);
    cursor.moveToPosition(position);
    database.delete(ExampleContract.ExampleEntry.TABLE_NAME, ExampleContract.ExampleEntry._ID + ""=?"", new String[] {cursor.getString(cursor.getColumnIndexOrThrow(ExampleContract.ExampleEntry._ID))});
    //should i close the Cursor here?

But that doesnt work properly, because it provides a Cursor which is not up to date. So do i have to create a 2nd Cursor after deleting the entry? That seems weird. And that would be a lot of Cursor creation and closing.

3) When you look at my code above, i try to delete a database entry depending on its position in the Adapter. Not by any of its columns. Is that approach ok? I have the onClickListener in my Adapter's ViewHolder and since its static there i cant really access any fields. But i can get the Adapter position, so i pass that to the Activity and work with that. I basically say ""delete every row where the ID matches the ID of the entry of the Cursor position.

9645,I want to learn programming for a very specific and simple app and I'm not sure if it warrants a more traditional start,"I'm sure some of you will ask me to look at the sidebar for info first, and I did, but I believe this to be a sort of special case. My main goal here is to create the app, and not to learn my way around android development. 

To give you a sense of what its intended purpose is:

The app has a very basic flowchart where users are required to input 5 separate bits of information, 2 of which are multiple choice questions and the other 3 are numbers that the users input. This info is then manipulated using very simple rules and  output is a smaller code similar to 1423_X15_AB_11 - that's it, a later step would be searching for the code on chrome, but that's not necessary now.

I'm not sure how to start, however. Should I take a traditional path of learning the necessary languages and finding out how to do it along the way, or should I seek something more specific ? What's a course you would recommend that could be targeted towards this, yet work for beginners ?",1509362908.0,2017-10-30 11:28:28,1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/androiddev/comments/79fl5q/i_want_to_learn_programming_for_a_very_specific/

I can connect fine via tcp during adb but have little sign networking is working on the bootloader screen. i can't seem to communicate during fastboot so i can't unlock the bootloader.  Incredibly frustrating.

There is *one* piece that makes me think networking is enabled

This pdf mentions pinging the device and then -t pinging it (page 5 second table under fastboot) - https://01.org/sites/default/files/documentation/android_4.x_build_image_guide.pdf

i couldn't believe it when his ip was set as the same the my AIO *says* it will set for usb debugging (it doesn't), and i after i set my pc to the same ip as his and connected directly i could ping.  

Anyone have any thoughts? Most of the resources i can find are official or formal release doc stuff, see below.  

https://sourceforge.net/p/android-x86/system_core/ci/nougat-x86/tree/fastboot/fastboot_protocol.txt

and other bits in the release doc for x86 - https://sourceforge.net/p/android-x86/system_core/ci/nougat-x86/tree/fastboot/ - like this list of commands

https://android.googlesource.com/platform/system/core/+/master/fastboot/README.md


I know you can use udp too - https://github.com/aosp-mirror/platform_system_core/commit/4601c978cad8b69e15ed63664ebb5dcf6aaf21b3

https://supportforums.cisco.com/t5/lan-switching-and-routing/prioritizing-udp-over-tcp-using-qos/td-p/2379534

but i am having enough trouble as is.  That said, if anyone thinks this is the best option **please** let me know.

I am also open to any other option out there.  I have the droidboot bootloader on my desktop, not that i know what to do with it. Or should i try to unlock it some other way? Could i somehow enable fastboot over usb even though my device doesn't support it?  An app maybe? Bootloader screen is looking for installer.cmd file, maybe that?

I wrote this basic TCP Client in Android with a C++ Server running in Linux.

Now the thing is this worked through Ethernet with a Rooted Samsung Note 2, however, with a brand spanking new Samsung Galaxy Note 8, it no longer works. Everything works great on the Rooted Note 2. But when I try to open up the connection to the server on the Note 8 the app crashes.

Granted the Note 8 phone is not rooted, however, I didn't think it would be necessary since it supports Ethernet natively.

Basically my question is, does any of you guys have any experience with sockets and TCP communications on the Note 8 through an Ethernet connection, or have any idea of what might be causing the app to crash when I try to connect on the Note 8?

The server still establishes the connection in C++, but each time it does the app crashes on Android.

9686,PSA: Android Gradle 3.0.0 breaks using color variables in vector drawables,"So with the recent Android Studio 3.0 release I started using Kotlin and Java 8 features and so had to update the Android Gradle plugin to 3.0.0

Because of this I now get this error for each vector drawable that uses a @color variable.

For example:

    A failure occurred while executing com.android.build.gradle.tasks.MergeResources$FileGenerationWorkAction
      &gt; Error while processing C:\Android\AndroidStudioWorkSpace\Joaomgcd\src\main\res\drawable\tag_multiple.xml : Can't process attribute android:fillColor=""@color/tag_icon"": references to other resources are not supported by build-time PNG generation. See http://developer.android.com/tools/help/vector-asset-studio.html for details.

This was working fine on previous versions of Android Gradle and is not mentioned in this [migration guide](https://developer.android.com/studio/build/gradle-plugin-3-0-0-migration.html) at all.

I could add 

    vectorDrawables.useSupportLibrary = true

to my build.gradle but then vector drawables won't work correctly in some situations on pre-Lollipop devices (like notifications and preference screen icons).

Is this an oversight? Is it intended? I don't see why it would be intended since it seemed to be working correctly before.

Most importantly, does anyone know if there's a way to get this back? It's breaking my ability to update my apps properly right now.

9687,Does anyone know a complete resource for creating custom components that walks you through the pitfalls to avoid?,"A little background.

I'm creating a custom component for my app. It's a dynamic list of EditText fields that automatically shows a new field when you type on the last field of the list and shows a delete button next to every field but the last. Kind of like the fields on the official Android Contacts app when editing a contact.

During the process I fell into God knows how many pitfalls. My listeners where overlapping and creating infinite loops, my state wasn't being kept when rotating the device, my custom component inherited too many properties because I extended LinearLayout (ended up solving this by extending FrameLayout and having a LinearLayout private field as my container for the EditTexts) and so on.

I figured most of my problems could be avoided if I fully understood the lifecycle of an Android visual component. The official documentation does show the steps of the lifecycle but doesn't go in depth about how they interact with each other. Also most examples I did find where small in scope and avoided most of the pitfalls by simply not implementing the situation that triggers them.

I wonder if there is a good resource where someone fully explores creating a custom component for Android, going in depth on how the lifecycle events interact and how to avoid said pitfalls.

9715,[Question] - Running/Fitness Music App,"My apologies if I am posting ""without due care and attention"". I read the rules and did my best! First posted in r/androidapps - it was suggested I re-post my question here:

I am primarily a music composer and producer - not an App Developer. I use a DAW (Propellerhead | Reason), which provides the ability to change the tempo of a music track (BPM) during the editing and composing process - without detriment to the pitch, tone, chords and melody. Tracks can be output in high quality as .WAV, .MP3 and - with some degree of detriment - as .MIDI. I am looking for interested App Developers to collaborate on producing a new type of Running/Fitness App, which allows the user to set the tempo (BPM) of their chosen tracks (which I will produce) - or to chose an automated setting which utilises the smartphone's gyro- or cardio-features to determine a pace/beat and set the tempo accordingly.

According to the research I have completed, no such App exists - although there are many fitness/music player Apps - none have a feature or function which sets the tempo to a user-, gyro- or cardio-specified requirement. I'd be happy to be corrected on this research, if such does exist!

I'm using a CursorRecyclerViewAdapter (https://gist.github.com/skyfishjy/443b7448f59be978bc59) to display the data from the database.

I'm looking for some help reducing this time significantly.

The biggest slowdown culprit is doing a LIKE %string% on one of the columns.

**Things I've done so far:**  
* Re-ordering the parameters of the query  
* Indexing the various columns used in the query  
* Increasing the database pagesize  
* EXPLAIN query and trying to optimize based on those results

* FTS3/4 Virtual Tables?   
* Changing the model completely and not using the CursorRecyclerViewAdapter - but I don't know of a better method.  
* Something else?

&gt;`**&lt;foreground android:drawable=""@mipmap/ic_launcher_main""/&gt;**` which would be the .png file

and 

&gt;`**ic_launcher_main.xml**` which holds the above code

This created a circular reference, which Android Studio didn't seem to pick up on.

What happened as a result was that SystemUI kept on crashing, as well as the phone's launcher (Pixel Launcher, as well as other launchers that support Adaptive Icons), not letting people even get to their launcher - let alone go into Settings to uninstall my app, eventually leading the phone to restart and the same thing would happen over and over again, causing a bootloop. **This did not require them actually opening my app, but simply having my app installed would cause the bootloop.**

The only solution was to uninstall the app via adb (if you were lucky to get in there in time before the phone restarted AND also have USB debugging enabled), but eventually you would get prompted by Android to do a factory reset, which to the dismay of a few thousand users of my app - had to do. Now fortunately, I was able to get down to the bottom of it within a couple of hours and had the update out immediately... but that still meant that a few thousand users were affected and had to factory reset their phones (a few of which were already on the phone with Google for an RMA), and I'm sure this has forever negatively changed the perception of my app for these users.

Now I know that I should have double checked / been more careful when I was naming my assets, but I guess shit happens and it was strange that Android Studio didn't pick up on this. ***What I find even stranger though is that such a small bug could cause devices to infinitely bootloop.*** Look, I'm not here to rant, but to somehow be able to positively contribute to the android dev community in the form of a PSA. I also know a few Android team devs lurk here, so I hopefully wanted to see if I could get some attention on this here.

~~**So I guess the last thing I want to know is: where can I report this?**~~

9744,"I also discovered a bug that causes bootloops on devices with API15+, almost 3 month ago. Google marked it as Won't fix. What should I do?","[This post](https://www.reddit.com/r/androiddev/comments/79y61p/i_discovered_a_bug_with_adaptive_icons_that/) made me want to speak out too.

Back in August I have found what I consider to be a critical issue in Android, that allowed me to produce a small APK which upon installation puts device into **bootloop state**. The only way to restore device then - is a factory reset. It affects devices running **Android 4.0.3 (API 15)** or maybe even earlier (API15 was lowest emulator I was able to get). It bootlooped my FireTV stick, Google Player, Nexus 5X and Google Pixel.

I don't want to uncover a way to reproduce this bug, because I believe that it can be easily exploited, e.g. to attack testing farms or to harm users. Google asks for at least 60 days for bugs disclosure, but I'm still willing to keep it private.

So I did what every good developer would do - I filed a bug report on Google's issue tracker, providing all the details to reproduce the issue. And after couple weeks this is what I got as a response:
&gt; The Android security team has conducted an initial severity assessment on this report. Based on our published severity assessment matrix (1) it was rated as not being a security vulnerability that would meet the severity bar for inclusion in an Android security bulletin. 

Bug got marked as **Won't Fix (Infeasible)** and haven't got any update since. it was around the time Android Oreo got released, and of course latest version still have the bug. 

If you are a Google employee, you can probably get access to the bug using its internal **Android ID: 64610199**. I don't want to post link to issuetracker (even though it seems to be with limited access).

If I've found it - somebody else will eventually find it too. And somebody might try to exploit it. I tried to help - but didn't got any success. Hopefully I'm wrong, and the bug is not as dangerous as it seems to me. But what if it is?

9747,When to use a Fragment vs Activity?,"I'm a 4th year student in my universities CS program. I'm taking Android Development as one of my last electives as it's always been on my bucket list to learn it.

My teacher isn't bad by any means, but he's said many times that he opts to teaching us the easy way when possible so that more content can be covered.

So far, all of our apps have had a single activity that creates different fragments for functionality. I haven't ran into a situation where this hasn't worked yet, but I also am hesitant to think this is the ""Proper"" way of doing things.

I just wanted to see if anyone had a good explanation of when it's appropriate to use a Fragment and when it's appropriate to use a new Activity.

9758,In need for advice about app development,"Hi everyone,
I'm a PhD student studying clinical psychology and very interested in what mobile applications can offer to people in need. I'm thinking now quite some time about developing a relatively simple app including health information and responsive messages based on the input of the app users. Furthermore, I'd like it to monitor certain behaviors and time passed since users have engaged in those behaviors. Based on the monitored behaviors certain milestones might be reached and users might earn eg. badges.
Unfortunately, I only have some basic Python experience. Based on your knowledge and experience, do you think it is possible for a beginner to acquire the necessary knowledge to build such an app himself? If yes what approach would you suggest? Would taking courses via eg. Udemy be sufficient for the functions I need? 
Finally, cross-platform functionality would be desirable.

Thank you for your time!",1509617311.0,2017-11-02 10:08:31,8.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/androiddev/comments/7a310i/in_need_for_advice_about_app_development/

* Realm: **4.1.1**


The application has a backup functionality, when click on backup, app replaces the database from External Storage to realm database location /data/data/com.app/files/notes.db

Now, What I did was deleted the app from mobile and replaced it with the **version 5.0.0(debug build)**.


I have a backup of database at external storage which contains **around 500 rows** which was created using App **version 1.0(debug)**

9779,Working on a homebrewed Dependency Injection Library. What do you think? https://github.com/mformetal/Kodi,"Library github link: https://github.com/mformetal/Kodi

The core values behind this library (Kodi - Kotlin Dependency Injection) are:

1. No compilation or annotation processing. It tends to bog down my local machine at home.
2. Type safety. If I bind a Type&lt;Something&gt;, I want to retrieve exactly that Type&lt;Something&gt;.
3. DSL with Kotlin. Declare and retrieve bindings in your dependency graph how you would say them.
4. No external dependencies.

Internally, Kodi uses a tree. Each Node of that tree has a Module, which is a collection of bindings, a Scope, which defines what components can access what bindings, and children, which define components that depend on each other.



Brutally simple Android example:

Initialize Kodi's root Node with a LocationProvider.

Start an Activity. Bind a Node to Kodi's tree with a Scope&lt;Activity&gt;. Declare a binding on that LocationProvider, which transforms its emissions into a LocationWithTime, with the type LocationTransformer.

Add a Fragment. Declare a dependency on Scope&lt;Activity&gt;. Retrieve that LocationTransformer, and display its emissions in a RecyclerView.

Reading the source code would probably be much more helpful, or looking at an app of mine that uses Kodi for its dependencies:

In SCRUM does the PO come up user stories themselves with the aid of the user or does the whole team get involved?

Any experience of either methodology failing drastically?

I'm currently learning Java with the SoloLearn app and got a hold of the Head First Android Development 1st edition. Figured this would be an awesome compliment. 

That is until some of the code in my first app had red text in the java code. I am new to Java but I am guessing it is due to either A) my jdk version is a lot newer than what the book was written for or B) the targeted android sdk API I selected, 7.0 Nougat:

and in an /r/androidapps post ([here](https://www.reddit.com/r/androidapps/comments/7ad2ca/dev_secure_photo_viewer_protect_yourself_from/))

I will also do so on tomorrow's App feedback thread, but that are all options that I have come up with. I think actually promoting the app is the hardest part of everything, but can also be the most rewarding one if done correctly. 

I have been lucky to create something that doesn't exist yet, or at least I couldn't find it yet. That should make it easier. But as it doesn't appeal to any special groups, it's hard to find a good way to drive traffic to the app.

Do you know some good ways to do that? I don't mind small costs, but most paid services are fake reviews and fake installs.

9851,"Indie devs, speak up: Your success stories and tips!","Hi @all,  

I thought it would be a nice idea to get some positive stories from indie devs who are actually lucky/successful on the app store since it is pretty easy to find all the negative opinions and stories.  

So please, tell us how you forged your path, what hurdles you had to take and where you got your ideas. And naturally, what tip you would give to other indie devs out there who are still struggling with it all.  

As background: For the past 3+ years, I have been fighting a serious illness with no end in sight that left me disabled and has turned me life upside down. Being self-employed, I can no longer take on any client jobs since my illness makes planing ahead and predicting anything time-based pretty much impossible -- which no client would understand. So, I am trying to venture into app development as a business since that I can tackle in my own speed without anyone pressuring me and hopefully in harmony with my illness somehow. The problem for me is, I am a very technical-minded person... I love figuring out how things work, programming languages, debugging and so forth. But when it comes to creativity, that is limited to the technical side of things (programming, ...) but not generating app or game ideas. That is where I am struggling. So hopefully some comments will give me some insight how others, who are doing this as a business, are ""generating"" their ideas.

9858,Live wallpaper killed but not un-killed,"I'd *really* like to fix a problem with my live wallpaper, and I hope it *is* fixable and not an Android bug I'm stuck with. This issue is not unique to my program, I've reproduced the problem with several other wallpapers, so I'm kinda spooked that maybe there's nothing I can do.

The wallpaper gets killed in the background to free up resources, which is fine, with something like this in the log:

    11-04 09:42:22.029 505-505/? W/WallpaperService: Wallpaper service gone: ComponentInfo{net.chaosworship.tetroidlive/net.chaosworship.tetroidlive.TetroidLiveWallpaperService}

    11-04 09:42:22.359 505-1806/? I/ActivityManager: Process net.chaosworship.tetroidlive (pid 19171) has died.

The problem is that it doesn't restart when it's visible again, there's just black (not a frozen last frame, it always turns black).

I can get it going again by bringing up its preview in the wallpaper picker, *not pushing ""set wallpaper""*, and returning to the home screen. Bringing up a preview for a different wallpaper and then returning does *not* fix it; it has to be a preview of the one that's set.

My device is 4.4.2

I can't get an 8.0 emulator to kill the wallpaper at all, maybe because it uses the wallpaper on the activity switcher list thing?

Anybody have any ideas? Can anybody assure me that I *can't* fix it?

9885,Need a part-time developer to build a niche classifieds-like app,"Please forgive me if this is the wrong place to ask this. I read the FAQ and trying to answer most of the things mentioned there.

This is not a very serious commercial venture, just something I'm thinking of doing on the side. So the development can be slow paced and the developer too can just do this part-time. It is a fairly simple app and shouldn't take much time in my view.

The app: It is basically a niche classifieds-like app that will list a bunch of text information about each item and also a few photos. I'm hoping the photos can be stored on a third party host like Imgur. I like the way Slide app for Reddit works for image uploading and viewing and hoping this could be similar, also considering that the slide app is open source.

Marketing: Thinking of using Google ads to target the locals of the city this app is for. Will expand slowly to other cities and maybe countries if it's working well.

My skills: I am a huge tech enthusiast and I would have learnt coding and development myself if it weren't for the time constraints of my career. I know Photoshop and basic Illustrator and I will be providing all the visual and functional design, you will just need to implement it. Aesthetics of the app will be a huge priority for me. I also understand the target audience very well and am confident of the success of this app.

Revenue sharing: We can talk about this but I think sharing a percentage of profits would be good. I don't have a lot to invest but I can pay a little bit upfront if I like your work.

Please feel free to PM me to discuss any further. I genuinely think this app will succeed commercially if done well. This is an untapped market that had no good quality players right now and this is the best time to get in. I believe I understand consumer psychology very well and have had quite a few successful online ventures before.

9889,Kotlin. Everything.,"It seems to me, the whole Android Dev community is all pushing towards Kotlin. There are plenty of talks, articles, demos and tutorials on the language and its use in Android development. Everyone seems rather excited. 

So my question is this; is it the general consensus that Kotlin will become the default and go-to, language for future Android development and we may see some support drop from Java from the likes of the Android team? 

With the above in mind; should I be writing all new apps with this language? 
Lastly, what is everyone’s thoughts on projects which mix the two languages ?

9890,Dynamic Menu From Firebase,"Hello, 
Would you please advice the best way to structure menu data in Firebase? I want to create menu Dynamically from Firebase and mostly it will be retrived once until it's edited on Firebase
(So Shall I retreive the data as a List of Object on Firebase) I think each button object will have the following info:

id:  ""10000"" //unique Id

description: Service //English description

descriptionsp:servicio //Spanish description

mainid: ""None"" //Id of the calling Button here will be None since it will be in the root

IconPath:""icons/10000"" // Path of the Image on Storage

id:""10001""

description: AC Installation //English description

descriptionsp:AC instalación //Spanish description

mainid: ""10000"" //Id of the calling Button here 

IconPath:""icons/10001"" // Path of the Image on Storage

and So On ... first time application run will retrieve all the data in the menu path after that will check if the date on the device is equal to the date on the upload date on the firebase if not it will retrieve delete data on the device and retrieve it again from the cloud
 after that root menu will be displayed with Icons when clicked it will display the next subicons which  mainid is equal  the clicked one and so on to the final level.
Final level might have option for example  user might choose brand of the AC as like Samsung,LG...

Hope it's clear Thank you.

9891,Real time screen OCR,"Anyone remember when Google ""on tap"" had the select text on screen feature and then they got rid of it when they upgraded to Assistant, personally i used that feature SO MUCH and can't really find a replacement that's quite as good, the fact it floated over the current screen and let you click on a body of text to select it is something that's really not achieved by anything else, plenty of apps that will scan a screenshot which is all very good but its an extra step that, having had the Google option in the past (thus knowing it's unnecessary), starts to feel like a real pain in the ass haha so can anyone make something to be an effective replacement for this lost feature? 

This isn't a commission request or anything, just someone desperate for an app to replace something I used to use so I suggest the app could open to display a text box to be able to copy bits from it after tapping the body of text, and then display an ad box on that screen so this isn't just an act of good will from a good developer

TL/DR: anyone have the knowhow to make a floating OCR app that lets you tap on a body of text after activating the app, to select that body of text for copying, perhaps laughing into the app with a text box to copy from (with the potential to advertise below it to subsidise development)",1509993694.0,2017-11-06 18:41:34,3.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/androiddev/comments/7aznqk/real_time_screen_ocr/

9924,Selector Problems in ListView,"I am working on a project that has me going slightly bananas.  I am fairly new to Android dev and inherited this project.  The UI was working fine until the device is upgraded to Nougat, then the rows in the ListView no longer had the desired styling.  I discovered that the breakage happened because the Adapter's (CursorAdapter) ""bindView"" method is where the background color of the row's views was being set - and after the upgrade, it's no longer getting called like it was before (pre-Nougat).

I fixed most of the problems by setting a selector on the ListView (through the ListFragment's ""getListView""), but I'm still left with a small but very bad problem.  Setting the selector on the ListView was non-trivial, BTW, because I had to do it programmatically - we allow the user to select the background color, so it could not be done declaratively in XML.

So the code in the ListFragment looks like this:

    public void onActivityCreated(Bundle savedInstanceState) {
        setListAdapter(mAdapter);
        getListView().setChoiceMode(ListView.CHOICE_MODE_SINGLE);
        StateListDrawable sld = new StateListDrawable();
        sld.addState(new int[] { android.R.attr.state_pressed }, new ColorDrawable(desiredColor);
        sld.addState(new int[] { android.R.attr.state_checked }, new ColorDrawable(desiredColor);
        sld.addState(new int[] { android.R.attr.state_activated }, new ColorDrawable(desiredColor);
        sld.addState(StateSet.WILD_CARD, new ColorDrawable(otherColor);
        getListView().setSelector(sld);
    }

With this, after I click on a list view item, it takes on the correct background.  Unfortunately, when the listview is first rendered, the ""selected"" (default) item does not have the correct styling.  There is a call to setItemChecked which happens after the selector is assigned, but it doesn't seem to get the job done.

    getListView().setItemChecked(0, true);

When everything is rendered and ready to go, the topmost item in the ListView is black and there is no visible text.  Once I click it, however, the correct styling gets applied.

Is this clear as mud?  Can anyone help in some way?  Let me know if I need to provide more detail...  Thanks.",1510068377.0,2017-11-07 15:26:17,3.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/androiddev/comments/7b6cxo/selector_problems_in_listview/

9940,How do you structure a local data source using RxJava and Realm?,"I'm super excited that Realm now supports RxJava 2 which introduces the asFlowable functionality so thank you to anyone that contributed to this.

The problem I'm facing is how to best manage the life cycle of realm instances in my local data source singleton class. My local data source is similar to the Android architecture sample [here](https://github.com/googlesamples/android-architecture/blob/todo-mvp-rxjava/todoapp/app/src/main/java/com/example/android/architecture/blueprints/todoapp/data/source/local/TasksLocalDataSource.java)

In the Realm examples for RxJava, they instantiate a realm instance in the onCreate and close it in the onDestroy of the activity. However, since my local data source is a singleton, I won't have these lifecycle events to instantiate and close the instance.

The question is: should I instantiate a realm instance every time the singleton is created and close it only when the singleton is destroyed or should I instantiate a realm instance in the activity/fragment, inject it into the local data source, and then close it in the activity/fragment?

Any other suggestions are welcome. Thanks!",1510084999.0,2017-11-07 20:03:19,3.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/androiddev/comments/7b8b09/how_do_you_structure_a_local_data_source_using/

9942,Novice trying to build an App,"Hi everyone.
So i am a novice coder who wants to create an App for android devices. The app is relatively straight forward, all I need it to do is the following:
1) Have an initial screen where the user can sign up to the service and provide some background info. 2) I then want the app to display the users location on google maps. 3) I want the user to have a button that opens the camera function. 4) When the user takes a photo I want it to be saved to a SQL/PHP database on my server. 5) I want the location to be tagged with a flag from a set of 8 predetermined flags. 6) I want the user to leave a small description of the photo.
I would like this to save so the user can see this contribution and others that they add.
The reason for this is that I am carrying out a research project and need user contributions. I am hoping to develop this App alongside a 'master' website that displays the contributions from all users and saves all the relevant data. I am currently working on the website but have never developed an app before. I downloaded google app studio but dont really know where to begin.
Your help is greatly appreciated!",1510087934.0,2017-11-07 20:52:14,1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/androiddev/comments/7b8n97/novice_trying_to_build_an_app/
9943,"Yet another copyrighted content rejection, this time because of using GPL-licensed material","Hi,

the last days we had some threads here because of Google Play app rejection. Now I tell my little story.

Some month ago, I found a nice GPL-licensed game which needed some fixes and improvements. Touch screen control was unusable, glitches in memory management and so on. But the original author sort of abandoned the project, did not react on pull requests so I gave it a go on my own.

When I read about the problems here the last days, I thought of giving it a try at the Play Store very early, and yepp, of course my app was rejected. First time for mentioning the original game's ""brand"" in my description (I used another title): I wrote that this is a improved fork of the original one. I replied to the service address that the ""brand"" is no copyrighted brand, but a GPL-licensed open source project and therefore there is no problem. The answer was just the very same sentence from the first e-mail again.

Okay. I just wanted to be fair and mention the original project, no real need for that. So I deleted that part from the description and submitted again.

You all know what happened: The app got rejected again for using ""copyrighted content"", image assets from the original game. And this time, clearly not a robot was talking with me because the original game's name had a typo in its name.

Okay... they already know that the original game I forked is GPL licensed and therefore I am allowed to redistribute the stuff, but they are obviously not interested in that. So how to deal with it? Just let the Play Store release go and just release the Webbrowser build? That would be very sad for the gamers out there, and it is especially annoying when some WhatsApp-imitating ad bombs are allowed to release on Google Play.

9944,Best architecture practice for having 1 data object shared between 2 tabfragments ?,"I hope someone can point me in the right direction with the following architecture question. I have a rather large dataobject and 2 tabs that visualize (and manipulate) this object separate. What is the best common practice from an architecture point of view ? What I do now is one presenter for the main activity that holds this structure, and then feeding this presenter trough a bundle in the Pageradapter to the tabs. This seems somewhat of a dodgy workaround and I am sure someone has figured out a better way ? Also on the internet feelings on this topic are somewhat mixed with presenters/fragment suggested too.

I'm looking for advice on how to implement a scrolling behaviour like shown in the GIF (https://i.imgur.com/NBk3WVa.gifv) for Android. There is some stickiness on the last header. If not scrolled far enough, the view jumps back into position. Similar to this https://developer.android.com/training/animation/screen-slide.html

The first approach was to use a NestedScrollView, which contains two RecyclerViews. With that, it was not possible to snap the RecyclerViews into position when changing to the other.

The second approach was, to use a vertical RecyclerView, which uses a PagerSnapHelper, to snap into position, but I would need to use two nested vertical RecyclerViews, which doesn't seem to work.

We get a lot of contributors who are relatively new to Android so this is our way of giving back.

If you have any questions about the session let me know here and I'll try to get back to you before the session.

**How to access:**
The workshop will be broadcast live [here on YouTube Live](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6iZaRF3njH4).

**What is it?**
A free testing workshop that covers the basics of writing tests for Android and submitting them to an Open Source project such as ODK Collect. We’ll cover how to test Activities, Views, and other classes, as well as what can be done when writing new code to make testing easier.

**What all will be covered?**
- What should we test?
- How can we design our app to be more testable?
- JUnit tests for non-Android classes.
- Robolectric tests for Views, Fragments, and other discrete Android components.
- Instrumentation tests for general app behavior.
- How to submit a PR to add our new tests to the project.

**When is it?**
Wednesday, November 8th 
UTC 16:00 - 18:00 (PST 8AM, EST 11AM, CET 17:00, IST 21:30)

**FAQ**
*Will it be recorded?*
Yep! We’ll record it on YouTube Live for all of the people who aren’t able to make it.

*How long will it last?*
Around 2 hours, although the last 30-45 minutes will be Q&amp;A.

*Will we cover Dagger, Rx, etc.?*
Nope! This session will mainly be focused on the basics, specifically looking at how to add tests to existing code bases such as ODK Collect (although the same stuff applies to new projects as well). We’ll mention some of these libraries as tools to help make apps easier to test, but they won’t be covered during the session.",1510175142.0,2017-11-08 21:05:42,0.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/androiddev/comments/7bgwgh/free_android_testing_workshop_hosted_by/

Every build creates ota files and target files and I am putting them on a file server.

Something changed in a new version of okhttp where it is no longer possible to use old ways of viewing all network traffic for an android app with tools such as Burp Suite

Anyone know what changed or how to get around this? Is it okhttp doesn't accept proxy servers at all, or proxy servers with unsigned ca certs?

Thoughts?

Have you guys used large heaps in your apps and what have you noticed? Can I use large heap in just one activity rather than the entire app?

lately I decided to learn Android/Java development. 
Im a full stack programmer working as a contractor. Going into Android after I felt
limited with mobile hybrid techs like Ionic and React Native each with his own disadvantages and limitation. 

Learning Android and Java in 2017 is weird..
A lot if not most of the solutions to problems out there
on the net (blog posts, SO, Youtube, official docs etc) are 4-7 years old 
and many times even they are lacking. I was so surprised!

Coming from living with ""not mature"" lang/techs like Golang,
React Native, Angular4, React Native and such I was used to. 
The
idea that sometimes you want to do something and there is no where to find how. So I thought to myself  ""Android will be the good life, all is done all is figured out. tons of information and examples for everything"".

But NO! not only I cant find some relatively simple things, when I do, answers are super old and lacking!

Im having a really hard time, harder even then Golang when I picked it up and it was really hard to find examples/explanations to what you need because the size of the community and overall life time...

Why is that?? Is it because no one learn Android anymore??
Does any one feels the same?? Am I missing something? 

Im very confused..

However, while on the 2nd to last lesson, I found out that there was an updated version of the course(ud851). I decided to just finish what I started, so I've just finished the old course (ud853).

So, now I'm done with the first course (just starting to work on stage 2 of the movie app) and I'm planning on trying to make some easy apps, and also continue with the udacity courses.

I recently saw this [https://i.imgur.com/w3vFeIr.jpg] when using evernote's web clipper feature on my phone.  
Does anyone here know what the correct way of doing this would be?  
I am unsure if you would use a widget or a custom dialog interface.  
I have checked Google's docs for achieving this [https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/ui/dialogs.html#CustomLayout] but they only suggest using *&lt;activity android:theme=""@android:style/Theme.Holo.Dialog"" &gt;* to display a standalone dialog but do not provide details about how the correct way to do a custom dialog and write a theme for that dialog so it can be used in the manifest file.  
I have searched other sites like stack overflow and have found nothing except using that built in holo style for the dialog.  
I would really really appreciate some help and gaining some understanding of how to correctly achieve it.  
Thanks

10081,How do you all optimize loading times of placing many drawables onto the screen simultaneously?,"So my app needs to have a maximum of 50 images on the screen at the same time in a FrameView, they need to be placed on top of a base image. If I put these images into drawable, the app crashes after a few images are place with an OutOfMemoryError. But it works when I put the images in mipmap for some reason without crashing. So I placed them all into the mipmap folders. The images are VERY small too, the largest among them is 2.2 KB and the smallest is 398 bytes. The app works as intended, but performance is horrible after you place a few images onto the screen. The first few images will load quickly, but as you continue to place images onto the screen it gets progressively slower to the point where it may take multiple seconds to place the image onto the screen. I'm just using an ArrayList to put all the Drawables in, and then another ArrayList to put all the ImageViews and I load them into the view within my onTouchListener. Here's an idea:    
    
        drawableOverlays.set(index, getResources().getDrawable(R.mipmap.exampleImage, null));           
        imageOverlays.get(index).setImageDrawable(drawableOverlays.get(index));
        frame.addView(imageOverlays.get(index));
    
    
I've also tried using Glide and Picasso and those loaded in even slower. Am I approaching this wrong? How would you guys accomplish this? The funny thing is that this used to work flawlessly and when I was developing an update everything slowly got slower. I backtracked and reverted everything and it's still really slow - and I've tried it on the emulator and physical devices.

* I use the service to retrieve the current foreground app for a sidebar app
* I've have defined the usage in `accessibilityservice.xml` so that it is transparent to the user as demanded by google
* I only tell the user to enable the service if the user wants to use a feature that needs this service

10090,Correlation between Apps installs number and Google Play behaviors. Feedback request.,"Hello,
I'm just releasing my second game in the Google Play Store. I'm looking for feedback about the impact of the number of installs, on Google Store behaviors like ranking or featured.

This week I passed the bar of 100 installs. The days before I saw no movement on my keywords/ASO ranking in AppAnnie. I mean some keywords ranking were displayed, but the trend over day was just flat, no change. Since I passed the bar of 100 installs, a lot of new keywords appeared, their ranking is changing everyday, and globally the ranking is better. I check the history for my first app, and I saw the same pattern.

My 2 apps are now between 100 and 1000 installs. Do you know if there are other thresholds triggering other Google Play behaviors? Do you see any ranking improvement above 1000 installs? above 10 000? And if by chance (and hard work for sure) some of you had their Apps featured by Google, what was the number of installs at that time?

Thanks a lot for your feedback.

10117,Testing concepts in Android,"Hello all, just wanted to confirm my understanding of the different ways of testing in Android. Whilst I'm familiar with Junit testing, that's about it. I've been doing a little reading and watching the IO talks but wanted to confirm that I've taken this in correctly.

# Short Tests
* Quick running tests run on the JVM for rapid feedback
* Typically JUnit
* Can also use Roboelectric?
* Makes up around 70% of your tests

# Medium Tests
* Single focussed UI test
* Runs on real or emulated device
* Tests that need to touch the *real* Android framework
* Typically use Espresso?
* Makes you around 20% of your tests

# Long Tests
* Typically UI tests
* Runs on real or emulated devices
* Tests that need to touch the *real* Android framework
* Tests multiple UI components
* Typically use Espresso
* Talks to real backends in your company
* Makes up around 10% of your tests

## Question 1:
I'm happy with the MVP architecture so can comfortably write JUnit style tests. The real spanner in the works for me is Roboelectric. Given I can test Presenter methods in pure JUnit (with Mockito where necessary) why would I need Roboelectric? 

## Question 2:
My next step after that is to write more Medium Tests. Do I do this with Espresso or Roboelectric or both?

## Question 3:
What do you typically test in Medium / Long Tests? Would you test button clicks? Is this not done in a small test as your button click will be sent to a Presenter method that you've tested? Would you test attributes of the layout? Such as the font size or height width position of a view? Would that not be quite brittle?

10133,"BetterRandom: better algorithms, interfaces and seeding for PRNGs","Want to re-seed your app's PRNGs as often as possible, lest they invalidate your results the way RANDU did, but without slowing it down significantly? Want a CSPRNG that's faster than SecureRandom and as strong as AES-256? Want PRNGs whose output you can reproduce, whether by serializing the instance or just retrieving and reusing the seed? Want to use Java 8's stream methods (via the StreamSupport backports of the classes and interfaces) with your PRNGs, even when you're using an algorithm from another library? Want to use a Java 8 SplittableRandom as a thread-safe Random so you can pass it to methods like Collections.shuffle? Want a different PRNG algorithm altogether, like CMWC4096?

My new library BetterRandom will give you all of those, all through Maven Central under the Apache 2.0 licence. Even while it was exclusive to Java 8 and 9, 901 unique users cloned it on GitHub; now, it's available for Java 7 and thus for Android. Feedback and pull requests are welcome.

10177,What are my options to ban a device whilst not invading good users' privacy?,"Users do not want to give their information (such as a phone number, Facebook account, etc) to apps. I do not want to know or keep such data either, because then I would be responsible for safeguarding the data from hackers.

But, I need to ban some users. Since it would be a privacy invasion to identify a person, I could ban the device they use. Of course, they could just buy a new device, but buying a new one costs money.

I have browsed this page (https://developer.android.com/training/articles/user-data-ids.html) but it did not give a solution for cases like these.

1. On a chat app, a user abused others, sending his penis images to unconsenting female users. But I have no personal information about this user. I could instead ban the device he used.
2. A user used a trial app. The trial has expired. I want to prevent the user from installing the trial app again on the same device.

In both cases, I do not want to abuse my power as the developer. According to the document above, Google seems to have restricted everything so that developers cannot identify users or invade their privacy. But aren't the two cases above valid reasons?

I wish Google (since they should already know/have everything about the user/device) could just expose simple API's like these.

    void blacklistDevice(UUID developerID);
    bool isBlacklistedDevice(UUID deveoperID);

`developerID` is a unique ID for the developer. when `blacklistDevice` is called, the data that can uniquely identify the device and the developer ID are sent and stored on Google's private server. The data is NOT available to the developer, so the user's privacy is not invaded.

When `isBlacklistedDevice` is called, the same device-specific data and the developer ID are sent to Google's server and if the match is found (by a previous call to `blacklistDevice`), it returns true. The developer only knows that the device is banned; he does not get any information of the user or the device.

Aren't these API's going to solve many problems? But since there are no such API's, what are my options?


------
PS: Come to think of it, a trusted, respected company other than Google could do such services. A user registers to that company. The company now has the data to identify the user. My app shows a unique app ID to user. The user sends the app ID to the company, and receives a unique key. This key varies by the app ID, even for the same user, so the user is not identifiable by keys. But for the same user and the same app ID, the key is always the same. By getting this key from the user at the first start-up, my app can determine if the user is banned, without knowing personal details of the user.",1510719968.0,2017-11-15 04:26:08,12.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/androiddev/comments/7cu4o2/what_are_my_options_to_ban_a_device_whilst_not/
10178,Having some trouble starting out,"/startRant


I'm new to android, but have been programming for over a year in Python, and for the last few months in Java as well. I've got an idea for an open source app that I really wanted to make, but when I downloaded android studio, I realize I have *no idea* what I'm looking at.

Following the ""make your first app"" tutorial throws you into a new project that is already filled to the brim with stuff. I have no idea how the project tree is organized, or what any of it really means. 

What I really want to do is develop an app that is built ""ground-up"" as you would do if you were writing a program for linux. Of course I won't be reinventing android libraries, but I want to really *understand* what I'm doing and not rely on the IDE to work magic under the hood.

/endRant


I guess what I'm trying to say is that Android Studio looks like it's holding your hand so that you'll never actually know what is happening. I kind of am looking for a source (a book, blog etc.) that explains how to actually build an app without holding your hand with GUIs or prebuilt templates. Is that unreasonable to do? I've looked at some other open source apps and they seem much cleaner, but I still don't quite understand how it all comes together.",1510723984.0,2017-11-15 05:33:04,9.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/androiddev/comments/7cuhez/having_some_trouble_starting_out/

My requirements are simple: I need to store some strings (3 columns per row) and of course would like to show them on my app.  

Now, I know how to consume a REST API but not how to build it, and what I'm missing are the ""links"", the exact roles of everything I should use:

- how do I upload the data online? Do I create a local db before? If not, how do I ""give"" the data to the hosting company? 
- where does the Spring (or Node.js, Django ecc..) app that fetches it ""live""? In the cloud with the database? And how does it communicate with my Android code?

Big confusion, as I said. I realize I need to grasp the basics on how to glue all these things together. Any help, in form of big-picture answer or link to explanation, would be much appreciated.

I have no idea whether they are going to offer me an internship or a contract, since I will mostly be working remotely from college. I'm not sure if I should suggest one over the other, or if I should bring it up at all.

From what I've seen, this app should take me about 300 hours to bring to a point where they can demonstrate its effectiveness. My only estimate for payment is a web development internship I interviewed for, which paid ~$26 an hour. I will not be underpaid by this multi-billion dollar corporation, but I don't want to look foolish for asking too much, either.

10275,Can someone help me understand unit testing? Feels like I'm changing my code just to pass the test.,"I just don't get it. It feels like I'm having to inject all dependencies, no matter how small, even if used once in a single method, or change my code just so I can mock an object. Here's a simple example.  

[Note: The Android unit testing android.jar file has no actual code. It just throws exceptions.](https://developer.android.com/training/testing/unit-testing/local-unit-tests.html#mocking-dependencies)  

I am using MVP pattern. In a presenter class, I have several unit tests covering this method:

    override fun validateFields(email: String, password: String): Boolean {
            if (email == """" || password == """") {
                mView.showInvalidFieldDialog(LoginContract.INVALID_FIELD_TYPE.NO_EMAIL_OR_PASSWORD)
                return false
            }
            else if (!android.util.Patterns.EMAIL_ADDRESS.matcher(email).matches()) {
                mView.showInvalidFieldDialog(LoginContract.INVALID_FIELD_TYPE.NOT_AN_EMAIL)
                return false
            }
            return true
    }

The problem is that when the unit test hits Patterns.EMAIL_ADDRESS it is null, because there is no actual code there. Ok...so I have an Android dependency. If I have a dependency, should I inject it? 

    override fun validateFields(email: String, password: String, pattern: Pattern): Boolean {
            if (email == """" || password == """") {
                mView.showInvalidFieldDialog(LoginContract.INVALID_FIELD_TYPE.NO_EMAIL_OR_PASSWORD)
                return false
            }
            else if (!pattern.matcher(email).matches()) {
                mView.showInvalidFieldDialog(LoginContract.INVALID_FIELD_TYPE.NOT_AN_EMAIL)
                return false
            }
            return true
    }

Well, no. This just moves the NullPointerException from inside this method, to the test itself, because I need to pass the e-mail pattern matcher anyway.

Ok, so now I abstract it even further. I should create an interface that basically wraps this call, that way I can mock it later on.

    public interface EmailValidator {
        boolean isValidEmail(CharSequence target);
    }

    public class EmailValidatorImpl implements EmailValidator {
        @Override
        public boolean isValidEmail(CharSequence target) {
            if (target == null) {
                return false;
            } else {
                return android.util.Patterns.EMAIL_ADDRESS.matcher(target).matches();
            }
        }
    }

    override fun validateFields(email: String, password: String, validator: EmailValidator): Boolean {
            if (email == """" || password == """") {
                mView.showInvalidFieldDialog(LoginContract.INVALID_FIELD_TYPE.NO_EMAIL_OR_PASSWORD)
                return false
            }
            else if (!validator.isValidEmail(email)) {
                mView.showInvalidFieldDialog(LoginContract.INVALID_FIELD_TYPE.NOT_AN_EMAIL)
                return false
            }
            return true
    }

Now the test would be something like:

    @Test
    fun validateFields_validFields_returnTrue() {
        val mockView = mock(LoginContract.View::class.java)
        val loginPresenter = LoginPresenter(mockView)
        val mockEmailValidator = mock(EmailValidator::class.java)

        `when`(mockEmailValidator.isValidEmail(""dummy"")).thenReturn(true)
        val result = loginPresenter.validateFields(""test@email.com"", ""password"", mockEmailValidator)
        Assert.assertTrue(result)
    }

This passes. Just because android.jar doesn't contain the necessary code to do the pattern match, I have to resort to creating an interface, a class that implements that interface, AND pass in the validator to the method under test, all so that I can mock the simple dependency?

Is this really a better design? Is there a better way? It seems like later on, I'm going to have to create some interface and/or inject anytime there is some Android related code in the presenter. It seems like unit testing actually changes the way your code is structured, just so that passable tests can be made. What was a simple line now turned into an interface, class, and injection to a method. Please help me understand.

EDIT: I know that I can implement a private method that does regex e-mail matching to avoid this Android dependency, but the pattern matcher is there so why not use it?",1510942561.0,2017-11-17 18:16:01,28.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/androiddev/comments/7dfc5g/can_someone_help_me_understand_unit_testing_feels/

It is more or less just a spinner that you can provide an initial empty state to. My goal was to not stray away from the regular spinner implementation. I have found a bunch of similar projects out there but most of them replace the spinner with another view or something like that. The spinner can be used as a regular spinner as well so there isn't actually any requirements for providing and empty state at all.

10327,I wrote to AdMob about suddenly low match rates for banner ads in Android apps and they suggested I create an AdWords campaign...,"The match rate for AdMob banners in my Android apps dropped from being near 100% *for years* to 50-60% since August 1st. I have been in contact with AdMob several times and they say that nothing seems wrong from their end, it could all be regular fluctuation (except it's not fluctuating, it dropped 50% in August and has remained there for 3+ months). On my test devices, where I used to get an ad every single time I played the app, since August 1st I do not get an ad to load other than maybe one every 15-20 sessions at most.

AdMob made this suggestion in their reply:

""My advice for you would be to create AdWords campaigns to target an audience from the US to your apps. That will help you get higher CPC's and also increase the fill rate.""

When I asked for a little more info, they answered with pretty much the same: ""This is just recommending the publisher to create an AdWords campaign and target more users in higher-fill-rate countries in the US, so that they can attract a user base from higher-fill-rate geos and get higher CPCs.""

I've never created an AdWords campaign, my question is - are they suggesting that I create ads that would appear as the banner ads within our own apps? So that way we would be showing our own ads within our own apps? Is that what they are suggesting will get me higher fill rates and CPC's?

10342,Is holding Fragment instances(List of Fragments) inside a PagerAdapter a possible chance of a memory leak?,"As a beginner, I didn't know how the Activity holding the ViewPager communicates with the ViewPager fragments. Yes, obviously we could make use of interfaces for callbacks. But I followed a general practice from the stackoverflow community of holding list of Fragment instances inside a PagerAdapter.

I was wondering if this practice of accessing fragments inside a hosting Activity context, may cause memory leak. And also whether it is still being used or there is another way that I am unaware of. If there is a good github link to follow, that would be greatly helpful. 

Also, as I was revamping existing projects to MVP arch, Dagger2, RxJava2, etc, I was curious how a SwipeRefreshLayout is implemented alongside a ViewPager.
Although I have given it a try, I may have over-engineered stuff. Would appreciate a feedback.

10380,How not to get banned by user-generated content?,"I am about to create an anonymous chat app, not to earn quick money but mostly because I could not find one I like (all were filled with full-screen adverts, inconvenient, buggy, etc).

Currently my account has no policy strikes, but I had some bad experience so I am trying my best not to get policy strikes. I have read many horror stories from developers who got policy strikes from  their chat apps, mostly due to adult material or nudity in user-generated content.

Chat apps without a profile picture would be boring. But there will always be perverted users. For example, in the famous anonymous chat app I had used, it was not so rare to encounter profile pictures with a huge penis or breasts/vagina on the user list. Also, some users have typed explicit and disgusting messages that were exposed on the user list. There was a ""Report"" button in the chat screen, and the app said it monitored and would ban sexual pictures/chats, but either they were really not doing anything, or users seemed to have found ways to circumvent it.

Do developers really often get policy strikes by such explicit pictures/text from users? If so, how was that app still on the Play Store? If that app was just lucky, and I have to do my best not to get policy strikes, do I have to censor profile pictures/comments manually before they go live (shown to other users)? I also want my chat app to be a clean, safe, and pleasant place to chat, but I am not a company so it would be impossible to monitor things 24 hours a day.

10390,Rx2 websocket,"Hey guys!

Been playing around with Rx2, converting our codebase in my downtime. I've been stuck with this problem, and since I'm the only android dev at the moment, I would appreciate some input from other eyes.

We're using OkHTTP's websocket to ask for content from the socket. MyWebsocket class wraps the ok.newWebSocket() call with a Flowable.create(), and has emitter.onNext() in the onMessageReceived() callback.

What I'm having problems with is the subsequent architecture of sending messages to the socket and listening to the responses.

I have two methods on myWebsocket, getInfoA() and getInfoB(); both send a message to the socket, and the socket sends a response. Now, how do I segregate the responses to the different methods?

- I thought a simple filter on the Flowable for the correct message type and mapping to it would be enough, but...
- I can't send a message to the websocket, as the actual instance doesn't get created until there's a subscriber on the Flowable. So I need a subscription to it before I send a message.
- I tried subscribing with multiple subscribers, one when the Flowable gets created (this one gets all messages), the others in getInfoA/B(), but these latter ones don't get all the messages.
- Tried with .publish(), much the same result.

I think I'm having a massive brain fart. Any and all pointers would be appreciated.",1511267746.0,2017-11-21 12:35:46,6.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/androiddev/comments/7ea0xm/rx2_websocket/

10401,How do you learn how to use new libraries? Currently struggling to implement SQLDelight/SQLBrite.,"I've recently completed the Android Development course on udacity, but I don't have much of a background in java (basically just one intro course for java) so I'm kind of learning as I go.

So far I've implemented easier libraries with lots of tutorials such as picasso for images and retrofit with rxjava  to get and parse json files. I feel like I mostly understand what's going on for these. However, I'm really struggling to get SQLDelight/SQLBrite working, and there aren't many tutorials for these. Since I don't have a very good understanding of Android or even Java yet, the little snippets of code supplied aren't enough to get me going. There's obviously stuff that's implied that I have to implement, but I don't know exactly what. I think I understand the udacity course code to implement the sqlite database manually, but it seems like implementing these libraries involves understanding more complex concepts which I feel like I should learn.

So, how should I proceed in these situations in general? Maybe I just need to get better at reading other peoples' code?

What's the simplest way to modify my app to connect to it and stay connected, even after my app gets destroyed by the OS (after I navigate away from it)? This is one aspect of the life cycle I've had trouble understanding.

Is the answer that I need to keep it from being destroyed in the first place, e.g. by creating a persistent notification? I notice that some apps do this and even provide an advisory in their settings saying that the notification is necessary to ensure their app stays in memory (for alarms and what not). Do they do this because that's the only/best way? Is there any other (better) way?

If it matters, I want to do this to use the HC05 as my smart lock device. I want to get home, start the app, and never have to worry about unlocking my phone until I leave and my phone goes out of range of the device.

10482,Having trouble with a simple android app,"I wrote an extremely simple app as practice and for some reason when I try to run it, it just crashes (through ADB on a OP3 with LOS).

What I want my code to do is create a single activity that shows a button named ""Next"", which upon being pressed, changes the `TextView` above it to the next item in a preset string array. 

Here is the code: 

`activity_notepad.xml`:
    
    &lt;?xml version=""1.0"" encoding=""utf-8""?&gt;
    
    &lt;android.support.constraint.ConstraintLayout xmlns:android=""http://schemas.android.com/apk/res/android""
        xmlns:app=""http://schemas.android.com/apk/res-auto""
        xmlns:tools=""http://schemas.android.com/tools""
        android:layout_width=""match_parent""
        android:layout_height=""match_parent""
        tools:context=""com.example.xavi.notepad.Notepad""&gt;
    
        &lt;Button
            android:id=""@+id/button""
            android:layout_width=""wrap_content""
            android:layout_height=""wrap_content""
            android:text=""Next""
            app:layout_constraintBottom_toBottomOf=""parent""
            app:layout_constraintEnd_toEndOf=""parent""
            app:layout_constraintHorizontal_bias=""0.5""
            app:layout_constraintStart_toStartOf=""parent""
            app:layout_constraintTop_toTopOf=""parent"" /&gt;
    
        &lt;TextView
            android:id=""@+id/textView""
            android:layout_width=""118dp""
            android:layout_height=""72dp""
            android:fontFamily=""monospace""
            android:text=""""
            android:textAlignment=""center""
            android:textSize=""18sp""
            tools:layout_editor_absoluteX=""177dp""
            tools:layout_editor_absoluteY=""203dp"" /&gt;
    &lt;/android.support.constraint.ConstraintLayout&gt;


`Notepad.java` (the main activity):

    package com.example.xavi.notepad;
    
    import android.support.v7.app.AppCompatActivity;
    import android.os.Bundle;
    import android.view.View;
    import android.widget.Button;
    import android.widget.TextView;
    import android.widget.LinearLayout;
    
    
    public class Notepad extends AppCompatActivity implements View.OnClickListener {
    
        private Button btn = (Button) findViewById(R.id.button);
        private TextView text = (TextView) findViewById(R.id.textView);
        private Lineprint line = new Lineprint(new String[]{""Bob"", ""Jerry"", ""assfucker""}); //very mature string
    
        @Override
        protected void onCreate(Bundle savedInstanceState) {
            super.onCreate(savedInstanceState);
            setContentView(R.layout.activity_notepad);
            btn.setOnClickListener(this);
    
    
        }
    
        @Override
        public void onClick(View v) {
    
            text.setText(line.next());
        }
    }
`Lineprint.java` (the generator class):

    package com.example.xavi.notepad;
    
    
    public class Lineprint {
    
        private int i = 0;
        private String[] arr;
    
    
        public Lineprint(String[] strings)
        {
            this.arr = strings;
        }
    
        public String next()
        {
            String next_string = arr[i];
            i++;
    
            return next_string;
        }
    
    }

I thought that maybe my generator class was wrong, but I tried it out independantly and it worked as I wanted. I figure that there must be a problem with the way I'm trying to set up the `Button` class.",1511593265.0,2017-11-25 07:01:05,1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/androiddev/comments/7f65mi/having_trouble_with_a_simple_android_app/

10510,Displaying a huge list of items from Retrofit API call.,"I am working on my first Android app for learning experience and using https://api.gwentapi.com/v0/cards to display all cards from API call.

Problem is that in total there are 357 items. If I want to display a list of them all it would be EXTREMELY slow even if I would split it all in pages and load 20 per page. I need to make nested calls because as you can see from api each item has a url that leads to actual item data and if I want to display item image then I need to go even further ( https://api.gwentapi.com/v0/cards/y98GaIwyXb-HnN0rf0p1kQ/variations/KmKCZfxxW02yUe4klbWdcg ).

Well since i know React, go with React Native...

oh great...start learning it

realize that there are lot of issues, where people are able to build 98% app but you have to know native programming to do last 2%... -__- might as well learn native than, how hard can it be....

figure out what to learn 

ios or android

hmmm i dont have an iphone so lets start with android, cool..

in android you use java, but wait IOS has new thing swift that apple supports 

maybe there is something for android too since i hate java since college

turns out there is and andriod studio actually just started to support it great!!!!

start learning kotlin and android, 2 weeks into it
learn google has demoed a new whole operating system 
Fuchsia OS ... it can replace Android completely 

hmmm dont wanna learn something that's going to be obsolete...lets get advice

ask google engineers on quora

they say lot of things learned will be carried over, if gets replaced

continue learning android but then...

learn of new thing called Flutter, which Fuchsia OS is using for UI too 

and Flutter can be used to build app for Both platforms right now

however uses Dart.....

really wanna learn it, but know too early must wait 

New news Google engineers are adding Swift support to Fuschia OS 

......

since Fuchsia OS uses Flutter, does it mean Flutter is getting Swift support beside having Dart.

does this mean in future you'd be able to create Fuschia, Android/IOS (Flutter) apps using just Swift. 

And learning kotlin/android/java would be if not waste of time, less than ideal way.

I work for a small startup and we're currently three developers, each working on our own platform (iOS native, Android native and a Web App in Angular 2/4/whatever it is now), where we also do translations separately for all platforms. This means we're repeating these translations three times. Basically the web app translations is a superset of the mobile applications (contains all the same strings and more). The apps should be able to share the exact same translations. 

Does anyone have experience with moving translations out of native apps/the web app and to the backend? I'd imagine it to be a larger upfront cost, but that it's going to be very beneficial in the long run.",1511880617.0,2017-11-28 14:50:17,6.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/androiddev/comments/7fx4sh/moving_translations_to_the_backend/
10571,Android camera developer: My experience with Android Camera APIs,"This is my experience after testing camera1 thoroughly with a test app on 4 (older and newer) devices.

**android.hardware.Camera** (camera)

* Isn't it deprecated? Yes, officially - to push developers to the new API, *but you better don't believe it*! Many devices with SDK version &gt;= 21 (Lollipop or higher) only support the camera2 legacy implementation that *internally uses the first API*. Many relatively new devices (example: Samsung Galaxy A3 2014/6) still use this implementation, which has some bugs and is slower because streams must be converted to formats compatible with camera2. Additionally, camera1 String parameters supported by manufacturers are *not* mapped to camera2, so I may be able to set sensor sensibility (ISO) manually on camera1 while never being able to access it on camera2 in legacy mode. (At least I did not come across devices that support this mapping correctly.)
**camera2 should only be used on devices with hardware level != legacy.** Thats it! An alternative would be to implement camera2 as a kind of drop-in-replacement library and to refactor this mapping.
* focus modes: Different cameras do different things when changing to focus modes. Some set the focus to the closest point, when setting it to macro, others don't change focus. Usually focus should only change when autoFocus() is called in non-continuous AF mode.
* calling autoFocus() in continuous modes: On some devices the locks are not preserved and focusing starts again after some seconds, on others, the lock persists until cancelAutoFocus() is called.
* A focus lock gained with autoFocus() in auto/macro mode may persist until the next picture, until preview stops or until camera is released, depending on the device.
* On some devices, focus areas are less reliable in continuous focus modus. Manual refocusing by changing to AUTO or MACRO and then calling autoFocus() may be necessary to get satisfactory results.
* There are bad bugs in camera implementations. For example, parameters.getMaxNumMeteringAreas() may return 1, but setting the areas has no effect.
* Callbacks may be called after camera has been released, and consecutive calls to the camera instance result will fail.
* The preview callback in takePicture() may be called or not, if given, the other callbacks are always called, if given.
* parameters.getHorizontal/VerticalViewAngle(): Some devices offer a completely wrong or slightly wrong value.
* The worst thing: Image data of some second-rate models is made worse by reducing image information, for example, by aggressive denoising or edge-""enhancing"" algorithms (which always reduce important details if it is a live algorithm). Some of this may be corrected by tuning certain string parameters.
For example, my Galaxy A3 (2014) had less optical resolution with an 8 Mpx sensor than my iPhone 4! After tuning some string parameters (denoising, reducing contrast and sharpness ...) the images had full resolution and had nearly perfect colors. Yes, I needed to *reduce* sharpness and contrast to accomplish this. This was my motivation to build my own Android app, a camera hack which I preferred to any other camera app available.
These manipulations by manufacturers seem to be **by intent** and are probably a part of a **business strategy to make customers choose a more expensive model.**

10574,Thinking of architecture components for the first time - really confused &amp; need help,"hi guys,
im an old school android programmer and am targetting devices in India - so i have support everything all the way up from Android 4.4 even today.

I'm hesitantly dipping my toes into architecture components now and am very confused. Some of these questions may sound really dumb, but would appreciate some help. I'm coming from a place where I have a legacy app already working, so this is kind of harder for me.

What all should I be using and not using:

1. MVVM vs MVP.  What parts are absolutely needed ? For example I think ViewModel and LiveData are must have. What about Repositories, etc ?
2. Room vs plain sqlite (remember that people have already installed my app and have sqlite)
3. Dagger vs something else (we already use Dagger in our app already).
4. ButterKnife vs something else
5. RxJava1 - &gt; RxJava 2 (this im going to do)
6. My current app is in java. Should I switch to Kotlin while doing this conversion or after ?
7. is there anything new for backstack and navigation ?
8. Is everyone using ConstraintLayout now ? 
9. Is View still a good thing ? I'm especially concerned about screen rotation. In the olden days we used to use Retained Fragments and all... I'm confused on how that has changed.
10. What happens to backstack ? Some places i have read that this is handled in ViewModel ... in other places it seems a no-no. What is the right way ?
11. Are people still using stuff like Retrofit for APIs ?

Really appreciate any help.

10583,Injecting into Android Studio's build process.,"So I've built a tool that analyzes and modifies parts of an app during the build process (don't want to be self promoting, so I'll leave tool name and specific details out). It optimizes code on the bytecode level (like proguard, but far more advanced and does Android specific things) and identifies (sometimes fixes) likely security vulnerabilities. I have it working great with ant, but some parts I'm having issues with doing in Android Studio.

First my tools injects into the build and analyses, then modifies the class files prior to conversion to dex. This is easy, just my app like this

    applicationVariants.all { variant -&gt;
        variant.javaCompile.doLast{
            runMyTool(variant)
        }
    }

However some parts of the app process the encoded binary xml files, and the dex file itself. Yes I can just do it after the build, but then I have to remove the signature and ask the user to sign it again, as well as expect the user to well do another step. I can't seem to inject into the process post dx, but prior to signing. Ideally I would either inject right before signing, or right before packaging the application into the APK.

Any ideas on running my code at the appropriate time? (post dx, but before signing). Any help would be appreciated.",1511910487.0,2017-11-28 23:08:07,11.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/androiddev/comments/7g0wdv/injecting_into_android_studios_build_process/

What are your salaries and years of Android (and other programming) experience?

I've been a C++ Dev for the past 7 years for a government contractor. I sort of am tired of my job and want to try something new. I'm hoping to find something where I can work from home.

Mobile development, depending on the project, seems like it could be interesting. I have a descent amount of Java experience, and have only poked around with Android a tiny bit, so I probably would have a learning curve to starting an Android dev job. I also have experience with PHP, SQL, javascript, C#, C, and a few others.

My current salary is $110k + benefits in the San Diego area. From what I see, it might be pretty hard to get a work-from-home job at that salary (or more) as an Android dev with practically no Android dev experience. It seems industry standard around here is to get like a 10-30% increase in salary when switching jobs.

So I’m really new to Android Development and I’d like to make a simple app that includes an encrypted Pin and Password file for the user to store their information. I have no clue where to start with this. Here is what I believe to be the process in its most simplistic form:

Create a file 
// Encrypt it using an Android Library

Once the app creates the file. When the user wants to access it:

Decrypt file 
// User updates the contents in the file 
// Encrypt file again using Android Library

Any guidance on this problem would be great. I’m not looking to write my own encryption (yet) but I haven’t had any experience using an Android library nor am I completely sure about the intricate aspects of the creation of an encrypted Pin/Pass file.

10621,Udacity's Android Developer Nanodegree Program (beginner &gt;&gt;&gt; intermediate)? Is it worth it for a complete beginner? Would love to be job-ready in a year.,"Hey guys!

I would like to learn developing Android apps. I am really interested in programming. I want to change my career and become an Android app developer in the future. I have no programming experience, I am a complete beginner so I need to start somewhere at the very beginning. The only thing I know is that I need to learn and use Java to develop apps for Android. I have been thinking about this for months now and I feel like I still need some suggestions from you. :)

I have been looking for information on the web about where I should start studying online. I am not a big fan of those simple and free video courses because I definitely need a mentor/guide to guide me, motivate me and answer my questions throughout my ""journey"". So I found Udacity's Android Developer Nanodegree Program (beginner). After finishing that beginner program, people can proceed to the intermediate program to be job-ready in approximately 1 year. 

Link: https://www.udacity.com/course/android-basics-nanodegree-by-google--nd803

I really like the idea that there is a community forum with students and teachers. Also, and most importantly, you get a mentor who can help you to understand things better and review your projects, give you thorough feedback. I am willing to pay that $199 fee per month because I would like to take this seriously and, like I said before, become an app developer. Moreover, Google is in collaboration with Udacity. Hmmm... sounds good? Does that matter? Well, it certainly sounds good.

Anyway, I have read so many positive reviews about these 2 Nanodegree courses. It really seems like I can finally start somewhere. Actually I am excited about it because this course seems like the one I, along with many other beginners, need. Videos, challenges, quizzes, mentors, forums, community, feedback, reviews, projects and portfolios.

What do you guys think? Is this a good way to start? Should I enroll? With motivation and perseverance, can I become a job-ready app developer within a year by completing these two courses (beginner and intermediate Nanodegree)?

Thanks for reading my story and I look forward to your answers, suggestions. I really appreciate it. All kinds of advice are welcome.

Cheers! Have a lovely day!

ps. Treehouse' Techdegree is similar to this Nanodegree, seems to be the same kind of course, but they do not have an Android app development course at the moment.",1512003979.0,2017-11-30 01:06:19,7.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/androiddev/comments/7gax0d/udacitys_android_developer_nanodegree_program/
10622,Phone - Morse Code Key/Paddle Interface,"I am trying to think of ways in which to interface a morse code key/paddle with a cellphone, however some of my preliminary thoughts have lead to anything fruitful yet.

A morse code ( CW ) [key](https://i.pinimg.com/736x/bc/90/c3/bc90c39e4272458bbf054d4d37b707e5--ham-radio-cw.jpg)/[paddle](https://forums.qrz.com/index.php?attachments/by1-jpg.191368/) typicaly uses a 1/8"" headphone jack and depending on if it is a paddle or a straight key depends on if it is a 3 ring, or 2 ring jack. A straight key simply connects the two rings on a 2 ring jack to create the tone in a typical radio. A paddle is basically two straight keys in one device and one sides does a dah and one does a dit. 

To practice ham radio operators typically have a keyer / hardware that will create the tones for practice. [Amazon Code Practice Oscillator Kit \( No affiliation \) just example.](https://www.amazon.com/NightFire-Practice-Oscillator-3768-Electronics/dp/B01MTTG1YL)

My thought is that since my key/radio is already setup to a 1/8"" jack is it possible to use a phone to create a keyer instead of having additional hardware. This would allow me to practice anywhere I wanted instead of having to buy additional hardware/carry extra equipment. Plus allows me to learn more about creating apps/programing.

Some of the thoughts I have had so far are the following:

* make use of the pause/play/volume up/down features already present in headphones. However from my preliminary research this appears to be done via resistors etc which would mean additional hardware and not key straight into the jack. Although a few resistors isn't a big deal and could easily be had/created.
* Possible create a small tone at very low volume to be played into the right/left channels and then when the key is pressed it send the voltage to the mic and the app can determine based off the voltage/tone/etc which side of the paddle is pressed or if pressed at all.
* maybe short out one side or the other to ground and be able to sense the grounding of the right/left channels and play tones accordingly.
* Alternatively I could do something with the USB however this seems like it may be harder then a headphone interface.

Do you have any thoughts on how I might be proceed with this small project? I am not looking to make money as the major apps only have a few thousand sales anyways and it really isn't my goal to make a few bucks.

10624,App and server compatibility,"Dear /r/androiddev,

please help me for I am at a loss. For the project I am working on, there is a requirement that our app (iOS and Android native apps) has to be compatible with multiple versions of our server. The problem starts with older server versions that do not have a required REST API endpoint.

What would be the best approach to solve this predicament without having to completely rewrite our applications using some javascript or other black magic?

Edit:
To elaborate. The user can choose and change the instance of our server any time he wants to by entering its URL. The instance he chooses may not be up to date and not have the latest version of the API.

Our first idea was to have white labeled versions of our app deployed separately oh their respective stores but Apple killed that idea with their new 'single generic app' policy (see their [terms](https://developer.apple.com/app-store/review/guidelines/#spam), sections 4.3 and 4.2.6).

The only thing that we can think of, that will soften the blow, is a cross platform JavaScript solution, which can hopefully be changed at runtime or even be downloaded from the selected server. That will lead to rewriting our existing native apps which we want to avoid.

One thing left is to have a version compatibility matrix which will determine what to show in the app with the current server version, but that will exponentially increase our apps complexity and maintenance costs.",1512010773.0,2017-11-30 02:59:33,2.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/androiddev/comments/7gbnis/app_and_server_compatibility/

* I make an extension app, that is a service
* My app communicates with this app and forwards relevant functions to the extension app
* I only ask people to install the extension if they really need it
* I explain why I need to do it this way
* I make the extension app open source to prove, that I'm not misusing the service for bad things
* I offer the extension app from the github repo for direct install

This is quite some work but is working for my use case. Still I have to explain the user why he needs to install an app not available in the play store, but it seems like it's the best option...

* should I instead use ButterKnife? RxBinding? 
* should I use LiveData and Architecture ViewModel components?
* should I use RxJava to observe from the ViewModel? Should I use it for rest api consumption (or repository async calls)?
* should I use Dagger1, Dagger 2, Dagger 2.10+? Dagger is been hard to understand for me

&gt; Zing implements Azul's C4 (Continuously Concurrent Compacting Collector) garbage collection software technology, allowing heap sizes of hundreds of GBs without pauses.[6] Zing also utilizes Azul's technology for elastic memory, which allows memory heaps for Java instances to grow and shrink based on load. This dynamic heap scaling removes the need for most JVM and GC tuning

 Since in Android the main focus on developing apps without any ANR's/lags, which mainly occurs due to frequent GC.

10724,Deprecated in android,"I'm using progress dialog in my app that I'm creating, but I saw that it is deprecated since api level 26..After researching I found this:

 &gt;In android deprecation usually means “We will continue to support this, but we think there are better solutions”.
   Most of the times features are deprecated rather than immediately removed, to provide backward compatibility, and to give programmers time to bring affected code into compliance with the new standard.

So it means that it will not crash in api level less than 26, but will it crash for api level 26+?",1512388256.0,2017-12-04 11:50:56,2.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/androiddev/comments/7h9c1m/deprecated_in_android/

10732,Best practice to display custom notification when FCM push is received on background.,"After going through many links of stackoverflow and official android firebase documentations. I see there are two ways to display custom notifications when app is in background (swipe closed)


1) Use data message only

2) Use both data and notification payload

----
***1) Use data message only:***

According to stackoverflow links [1](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/41383238/firebase-notifications-when-app-is-closed/41383507#41383507), [2](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/40181654/firebase-fcm-open-activity-and-pass-data-on-notification-click-android/46097655#46097655), [3](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/40311279/firebase-onmessagereceived-not-called-when-app-is-in-the-background/40311918#40311918) and others, **onMessageReceived()** will be guaranteed to called


***2) Use both data and notification payload***

If the payload you sent has both notification and data, **Notification** part will be handled by the Notification Tray, while the **Data** part will be in the extras of the intent.

----
**Q) What is the best practice that I should implement to receive the FCM push notification that guarantees**


1- **100% Delivery**

2- **Less delays**

3- **Maximum Android devices (Xiomi, Lenovo)**

4- **Custom Style Notification**",1512407981.0,2017-12-04 17:19:41,9.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/androiddev/comments/7hb8cx/best_practice_to_display_custom_notification_when/
